- Release: Contains all the files that are required to install Kimai directly
- Stable: is the developer version of a release, needs some post-install work (like `composer install --no-dev`)

We keep an eye on server compatibility, requirements for Kimai are only:
<br/>**MySQL 4.3** and **PHP 5.5** (required extensions: mysqli, iconv, php-xml)

Please [visit us at GitHub](https://github.com/kimai/kimai/) to find out more.

## Development version

A development version is the latest package we are currently working on.
It might have new features, but it might be broken as well!

If you are an experienced user of Kimai and have the resources to help us with testing or just like to play with brand new features,
you can [download the latest development version](https://github.com/kimai/kimai/zipball/develop).

Please help us, test it and [give us your feedback]({{ site.issues_url }}) if you find any problems.

## More Downloads

Our documentation has information about fetching the [latest development version]({{ site.docu_url }}developer/index.html).

### Deprecated

A couple of years ago we hosted Kimai at Sourceforge, you can find all old versions there. 
But thats ONLY for informational purpose, so we advise: DON'T! That why we don't provide a link anymore ... its completely outdated.
