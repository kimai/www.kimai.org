	<blockquote>
		Kimai tries to get rid of the pain, feeding lame and boring excel sheets to record your work time.
	</blockquote>

	<p>
		Kimai does not have to run while recording, you can even quit your browser.
		Your time is still recording until you stop it from any web browser that has access to your installation.
		It is designed to hold lots of users, but you can also use it for a single user if you want to.
