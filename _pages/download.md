## Development version

A development version is the latest package we are currently working on, also referred to as the Git `main` branch.
It will have new features and bugfixes included (see [demo site]({% link _pages/demo.md %})), but it might not be as stable as an official release.
Experienced Kimai users can help us to test, by [installing the development version]({% link _documentation/installation.md %}#development-installation) 
and [leaving feedback]({{ site.kimai_v2_repo }}/issues) if you encounter any problems.
