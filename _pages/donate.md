# Support Kimai

{% include alert.html icon="far fa-smile" alert="By donating to Kimai and sponsoring the development you help us to improve your time-tracking experience!" %}

Developing a free software like Kimai takes a lot of time and effort.
If you like Kimai, if you use it on a daily basis or administrate Kimai in your company, please consider to donate and support further development.

Your donation goes directly into supporting the project. I am a professional software-developer dedicated to Kimai and with a heart for open source software.
Most importantly, by helping support the development of Kimai you are contributing to an effort that makes your life easier. Now isn't that sweet?

Thank you for using Kimai and supporting the development!
