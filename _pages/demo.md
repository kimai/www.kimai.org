# Test Kimai in one of the demos

{% include alert.html icon="fas fa-desktop" alert='Try out the Kimai time-tracking demo and we promise: your next step will be the download!' %}

Please choose one of our demo installations, to get a first impression on how Kimai feels and which functionality it provides.

{% include pages/demo-boxes.html %}

Be aware that the demos will be reinstalled on a regular schedule and all entered data will be removed. But for your convenience, they 
are pre-filled with test data, so you can directly start testing features (like invoice or export).

If you encounter any problem, I would kindly ask you to drop a message in the [issue tracker]({{ site.kimai_v2_repo }}/issues).

## Demo user

These accounts are available for your tests. Or you create your own test user in the login form of each demo:
 
{% include pages/demo-users.md user="Username" password="Password" api="API" role_user="User" role_admin="Admin" role_super="Super-Admin" role_teamlead="Teamlead" %}
