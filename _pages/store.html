									The central place to find new plugins and commercial support for Kimai.
								</p>
								<p>
									Any bundle, plugin and Kimai extension in here does only work with Kimai 0.9 and above,
									as the plugin mechanism was not existing before.
								</p>
								</p>
									Due to this constraint and the fact, that 0.9 was at the time of this writing (2019-02-21)
									not even released, the amount of items in here is limited.
								</p>
								</p>
									I hope to be able to feature more plugins in the near future.
