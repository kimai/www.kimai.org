I've created this page to make my policy around discounting clear.

I do offer a discount to [non-profit organisations]({% link _landingpage/en/non-profit.md %}) who want to use the Kimai-Cloud.

I never run seasonal promotions like Black Friday deals.
All discount codes found on discount code websites are fake and will not work.

This simple policy was created to ensure the fairest pricing policy for my customers.

Note: if you choose a paid plan with Kimai-Cloud, you will receive a 20-25% discount if you pay it annually instead of monthly.
