Activities in Kimai are meant to explain the kind of work done for a specific task/timesheet.

## Activity types

Activities can have two different types: `global` and `project specific`.  

{% include alert.html icon="fas fa-exclamation" type="warning" alert="Activities cannot be linked to a customer, the customer field in the edit form is only a filter for the project list." %}

### Project specific 

Activities can be assigned to a project, which means you can only choose them if the linked project is active.

### Global activities

Activities can be global, meaning they are not linked to a project and can be used in combination with every project.

Examples for global activities could be:
- meetings
- phone calls
- administrative tasks

These examples might vary heavily between different industries, the main usage are recurring tasks throughout all of your projects.

## Activity colors

Each activity can be assigned its own color, for easier identification in various screens.

If no color has been selected, the project color will be used. 
If that is not defined as well, Kimai will fallback to the customer color and finally to the [default color]({% link _documentation/customer.md %}).

## Budgets

{% include budgets.md %}

## Visibility
 
By toggling the visibility on an activity, you:
- hide the activity from all drop-downs, regardless of their visibility state
- hide the activity from the default list in the activities administration

Please note:
- all currently linked objects will still show the activity in the dropdown as pre-selected option
  - you can still change the activity on timesheet record, which used it before
  - you cannot create new timesheet records for this activity 
- you can still access the hidden entries by changing the visibility filter on the toolbars

The visibility filter in the toolbar has three state: 
- Visible: Yes (all activities that are "really" visible, meaning: the activity, linked project and customer are visible)
- Visible: No (all activities that are exclusively invisible by their own visibility state)
- Visible "empty" (all activities: not filtering on their own, the projects or customers visibility)

## Filter and search 

The search drop-down supports filtering by the fields:
- `customer`
- `project`
- `global` / `non-global`
- `visibility`

Besides these filters, you can query for a free search term, which will be searched in the fields:
- `name`
- `comment`

Additionally you can filter for [custom fields]({% link _documentation/meta-fields.md %}) by using a search phrase like `location:homeoffice`.
This would find all activities with the custom field `location` matching the term `homeoffice`.

The search terms will be found within the full value, so searching for `office` would find:
- `I love working in my office`
- `Office` 
- `This office is beautiful`
- `Our offices are very noisy`

You can mix the search term and use multiple meta-field queries:
- `location:homeoffice activityname foo` - find all activities matching the search term `activityname foo` with the custom field `location` matching the term `homeoffice` 
- `location:homeoffice contract:foo activityname` - find all activities matching the search term `activityname` with the custom field combination: `location` matching the term `homeoffice` and `contract` matching the term `foo` 
- `location:homeoffice contract:foo` - find all activities with the custom field combination: `location` matching the term `homeoffice` and `contract` matching the term `foo`
