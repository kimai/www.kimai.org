Kimai uses the 24-hour format by default.

If you want to use the AM/PM format instead, you can deactivate the [user preference]({% link _documentation/user-preferences.md %}) `24 hours`.

After making this changes, the Kimai UI should display all times in `AM/PM` format, and the date-time picker will change its behaviour as well.
