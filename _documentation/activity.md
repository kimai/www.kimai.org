Activities in Kimai are defining the current task you are working on.

## Global activities vs project activities

Activities can be assigned to a project, which means you can only choose them if the linked project was chosen before.
But activities can also be global, meaning they are not linked to a project and can be re-used with EVERY project and customer.

Examples for global activities are things like:
- meetings
- phone calls
- administrative tasks

So tasks which repeat in each of your projects.

## Activity colors

Each activity can be assigned its own color, for easier identification in the timesheets.

If no color is applied, the project color will be used.

See [customer documentation]({% link _documentation/customer.md %}) for the default color.

## Time budget
{% include new_since.html version="1.0" %}

{% include time_budget.md %}
