description: A brief explanation of the payment process and license options

Thanks for taking the time and your interest in a payed Kimai plugin.

Currently I am working on many different parts around Kimai and have not yet been able to 
setup a proper e-commerce solution.

I know this is probably not what you expect ;-) but I promise once I have setup a better 
system, I will import all licenses there and provide you with the same quality you are used 
from Kimai itself.  

## Order and Payment

You can pay via bank transfer or Paypal.

Please write an email to [info@keleo.de](mailto:info@keleo.de) and ask for the details.

## Quick license overview

The short version:

- A license will grant you access to a private GitHub repository, where: 
  - You get support via the GitHub Issues 
  - You can download the code as often as you want and get instant access to new versions 
  - You can leave your feedback and feature requests
- You are granted one year of access to the repository 
  - After that period, you will have to renew the license to get further support or downloads
- You are allowed to use the plugin in one test and one production installation
- You are NOT allowed to redistribute or sell the code in any way

And here comes the full version...

### Plugin license terms

1. The Regular License grants you, the purchaser, an non-exclusive, worldwide license to make use of the digital work (Item) you have selected. Read the rest of this license for the details that apply to your use of the Item.

2. You are licensed to use the Item in one single Kimai installation for yourself or for one client (a “single application”), and the End Product can be distributed for Free.

3. An End Product is one of the following things:
  - A Kimai installation hosted by yourself, so that you are acting as application provider either for you or your client.    
  _For example: you are administrating the Kimai installation for your employer or yourself._
  - A Kimai installation that you install (or manage) for your client, hosted by someone else.  
  _For example: your client pays you to install, administrate and update a Kimai installation for one company or person._

4. You can create one End Product for a client, and you can transfer that single End Product to your client for any fee. This license is then transferred to your client.

5. You can modify or manipulate the Item. You can combine the Item with other works and make a derivative work from it. The resulting works are subject to the terms of this license. You can do these things as long as the End Product you then create is one that’s permitted under clause 3.   

6. You can’t modify the Item in a way that prevents the built-in license checks by Kimai or which prevents the detection of the original Item name or license requirements.

7. You can’t sell the End Product, except to one client. If you or your client want to sell the End Product, you will need an extended license (contact us in that case).

8. You can’t re-distribute the Item as stock, in a tool or application, or with source files. You can’t do this with an Item either on its own or bundled with other items, and even if you modify the Item. You can’t re-distribute or make available the Item as-is or with superficial modifications. These things are not allowed even if the re-distribution is for Free.

9. You can’t use the Item in any application allowing an end user to use it on a "on demand" or "subscription" base, normally referred to as SaaS - Software-as-a-Service. You can use the Item in this way only if you purchase a separate license for each final product incorporating the Item that is created using the application.  
_Example of the "final product" application: for each Kimai instance on a subscription base, this might be either a single paying customer or a company with multiple user accounts. Contact us for discussion._

10. Although you can modify the Item and therefore delete unwanted components before creating your single End Product, you can’t extract and use a single component of an Item on a stand-alone basis.  
_For example: You license a plugin containing icons. You can delete unwanted icons from the plugin. But you can't extract an icon to use outside of the plugin._

11. You must not permit an end user of the End Product to extract the Item and use it separately from the End Product.

12. For some Items, a component of the Item will be sourced by the author from elsewhere and different license terms may apply to the component, such as someone else’s license or an open source or creative commons license. If so, the component will be identified by the author in the Item’s description page or in the Item’s downloaded files. The other license will apply to that component instead of this license. This license will apply to the rest of the Item.  
_For example: A plugin might contain images licensed under a Creative Commons CCBY license. The CCBY license applies to those specific images. This license applies to the rest of the plugin._

13. For some items, a GNU General Public License (GPL) or another open source license applies. The open source license applies in the following ways:
  - (a) Some Items, even if entirely created by the author, may be partially subject to the open source license: a ‘split license’ applies. This means that the open source license applies to an extent that’s determined by the open source license terms and the nature of the Item, and this license applies to the rest of the Item.  
Split and other open source licensing is relevant for most Kimai plug-ins. Where split licensing applies, this is noted in the Item’s download files.
  - (b) For some Items, the author may have chosen to apply an open-source-license (like MIT or GPL) to the entire Item. This means that the relevant open-source-license will apply to the entire Item instead of this license.  
Where an Item is entirely under a GPL license, it will be identified as a GPL item and the license noted in the download files

14. You can only use the Item for lawful purposes.

15. Items that contain trademarks or other intellectual property owned by others have not been property released. These Items are licensed on the basis of editorial use only. It is your responsibility to consider whether your use of these Items requires a clearance and if so, to obtain that clearance from the intellectual property rights owner.

16. This license can be terminated if you breach it. If that happens, you must stop making copies of or distributing the End Product until you remove the Item from it.

17. The author of the Item retains ownership of the Item but grants you the license on these terms. This license is between the author of the Item and you. Keleo is not a party to this license or the one giving you the license, unless Keleo is the author of the Item.

### Definitions
- **End Product**: See clause 3 of this license.
- **Free**: No fee is paid by the end user to access the End Product. The End Product is not sold.
