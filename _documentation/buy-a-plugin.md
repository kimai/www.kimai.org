Thanks for your interest in a payed Kimai plugin.

## Order and Payment

Kimai plugins are sold through the processor Gumroad Inc., which accepts payments via CreditCard and PayPal.

If you don't want or can't use this method, I offer direct bank-transfer payments as well.
Please write an email to [info@keleo.de](mailto:info@keleo.de) and ask for the bank account.

After successful purchase, you get access to the plugin files, which need to be installed in your existing Kimai 2 installation.
You get access either through Gumroad directly or in case of a bank-transfer payment via email.

### License terms for payed plugins 

1. The plugin license grants you, the purchaser, an non-exclusive, worldwide license to make use of the digital work (Item) you have purchased. Read the rest of this license for the details that apply to your use of the Item.

2. You are licensed to use the Item in one End product (a Kimai installation) for yourself or for one client (a “single application”).

3. An End Product is one of the following things:
  - A Kimai installation hosted by yourself, so that you are acting as application provider either for you or your client.
  _For example: you are administrating the Kimai installation for your employer or yourself._
  - A Kimai installation that you install (or manage) for your client, hosted by someone else.
  _For example: your client pays you to install, administrate and update a Kimai installation for one company or person._

4. You can create one End Product for a client, and you can transfer that single End Product to your client for any fee. This license is then transferred to your client.

5. You can modify or manipulate the Item. You can combine the Item with other works and make a derivative work from it. The resulting works are subject to the terms of this license. You can do these things as long as the End Product you then create is one that’s permitted under clause 3.

6. You can’t modify the Item in a way that prevents built-in license checks by Kimai or which prevents the detection of the original Item name or license requirements.

7. You can’t sell the End Product, except to one client. If you or your client want to sell the End Product, you will need an extended license (contact us in that case).

8. You can’t re-distribute the Item as stock, in a tool or application, or with source files. You can’t do this with an Item either on its own or bundled with other items, and even if you modify the Item. You can’t re-distribute or make available the Item as-is or with superficial modifications.

9. You can’t use the Item in any application allowing an end user to use it on a "on demand" or "subscription" base, normally referred to as SaaS - Software-as-a-Service. You can use the Item in this way only if you purchase a separate license for each final product incorporating the Item that is created using the application.
_Example of the "final product" application: for each Kimai instance on a subscription base, this might be either a single paying customer or a company with multiple user accounts (contact us in that case)._

10. Although you can modify the Item and therefore delete unwanted components before creating your single End Product, you can’t extract and use a single component of an Item on a stand-alone basis.
_For example: You license a plugin containing icons. You can delete unwanted icons from the plugin. But you can't extract an icon to use outside of the plugin._

11. You must not permit an end user of the End Product to extract the Item and use it separately from the End Product.

12. You can only use the Item for lawful purposes.

13. Items that contain trademarks or other intellectual property owned by others have not been property released. These Items are licensed on the basis of editorial use only. It is your responsibility to consider whether your use of these Items requires a clearance and if so, to obtain that clearance from the intellectual property rights owner.

14. This license can be terminated if you breach it. If that happens, you must stop making copies of or using or distributing the End Product until you remove the Item from it.

15. The author of the Item retains ownership of the Item but grants you the license on these terms. This license is between the author of the Item and you. Keleo is not a party to this license or the one giving you the license, unless Keleo is the author of the Item.
