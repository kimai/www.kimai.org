description: Projects in Kimai 2
---

Projects in Kimai are assigned to customers and are linked to activities, which are then used for time-records.

## Project colors

Each project can be assigned its own color, for easier identification in the timesheets.

If no color is applied, the customers color will be used.

If an activity linked to the project does not have its own color, the projects color will be used (and as fallback again the customers color).

See [customer documentation]({% link _documentation/customer.md %}) for the default color.

## Time budget
{% include new_since.html version="1.0" %}

{% include time_budget.md %}
