toc: true

Kimai 2 provides a flexible permissions system, which is based on [user roles]({% link _documentation/users.md %}) and 
can be adapted through your [local.yaml]({% link _documentation/configurations.md %}) config file.

## Understanding permission structure

Before you learn to configure the permission system, you have to understand the three involved config types:

1. `Permission sets` - a re-usable mapping of a free choosable name (e.g. `TEST`) to a list of: 
  - one or more "permission names" (e.g. `test`)
  - one or more "permission sets" (linking other sets can be achieved by prepending an `@`, e.g. `@TEST`)
  - one or more "negated permission names" (prepend an `!` to negate a permission, e.g. `!test`)
2. `Permission maps` - a mapping of a role name to a list of "permission sets" (no `@` required here, e.g. `TEST`)
3. `Permissions` - a mapping of a role name to a list of:
  - one or more "permission names" (e.g. `test`)
  - one or more "negated permission names" (e.g. `!test`)

An example and its explanation:

```yaml
    permissions:
        sets:
            ACTIVITY: ['view_activity', 'create_activity']
            TIMESHEET: ['view_own_timesheet', 'start_own_timesheet']
            PROFILE: ['my_profile', 'show_roles', 'other_profiles']
            EXAMPLE: ['@PROFILE', '@ACTIVITY']
            EXAMPLE_USER: ['@PROFILE', '!show_roles']
        maps:
            ROLE_USER: ['TIMESHEET', 'EXAMPLE_USER']
            ROLE_ADMIN: ['TIMESHEET', 'EXAMPLE']
        roles:
            ROLE_USER: ['!other_profiles']
            ROLE_ADMIN: ['delete_activity']
```

- In `sets` we define the `permissions sets` names "ACTIVITY", "TIMESHEET", "PROFILE" and "EXAMPLE".
- The `set` called "EXAMPLE" inherits the other `sets` called "PROFILE" and "ACTIVITY", so its contains 
the permissions: my_profile, show_roles, other_profiles, view_activity , create_activity.
- The `set` called "EXAMPLE_USER" inherits the `set` called "PROFILE" and removes the permission "show_roles", so its contains 
the permissions: my_profile, other_profiles.
 
In `maps` we now apply the `permission set` called "TIMESHEET" and "EXAMPLE_USER" to the user-role "ROLE_USER" 
and the two `permission sets` called "TIMESHEET" and "EXAMPLE" to the user-role "ROLE_ADMIN".

At this step the roles have the following permissions:

- `ROLE_USER` - view_own_timesheet, start_own_timesheet, my_profile, other_profiles
- `ROLE_ADMIN` - view_own_timesheet, start_own_timesheet, my_profile, show_roles, other_profiles, view_activity, create_activity

As last step, the list of `permission names` will be merged with the list of previously calculated permissions.
We removed the permission "other_profiles" from the user-role "ROLE_USER" and added the permission "delete_activity" to the user-role "ROLE_ADMIN".

At the end the system calculated the final list of permissions:  

- `ROLE_USER` - view_own_timesheet, start_own_timesheet, my_profile
- `ROLE_ADMIN` - view_own_timesheet, start_own_timesheet, my_profile, show_roles, other_profiles, view_activity, create_activity, delete_activity

Yes, that could have been easier ;-) but I wanted to demonstrate all possibilities!

## Configure permissions

Knowing that many companies need a different combination of allowed permissions than the default ones, 
you might also want to change the pre-configured permission.

After changing the permission, you maybe want to check the compiled result, which can be done via the users administration 
screen (for example in the [demo installation](https://demo.kimai.org/en/admin/user/permissions)).

### With 1.0 and later

In most cases you just want to adjust single permissions, like remove or add single permissions them to a user role. 
This can be done by adding something like this to your [local.yaml]({% link _documentation/configurations.md %}):

```yaml
kimai:
    permissions:
        roles:
            ROLE_TEAMLEAD: ['!edit_invoice_template', 'delete_invoice_template']
```
This example removes `edit_invoice_template` and adds `delete_invoice_template` for the user role `ROLE_TEAMLEAD`.

If you want to go further and want to re-adjust which `sets` are applied to a user role, you have to overwrite the 
complete map for that role. Lets assume you want to redefine user permissions and allow full access to tags, 
then you edit your `local.yaml` like this:

```yaml
kimai:
    permissions:
        maps:
            ROLE_USER: ['ROLE_USER', 'TAGS']
```
As you overwrite the default map `ROLE_USER` by defining it, you have to apply the default set `ROLE_USER` and append the set `TAGS` (see below in "Existing maps").

Customizing sets is generally not recommended, as you should be able to achieve everything with `maps` and `permissions`. 
See below in "Existing sets". 

### Before 1.0

The following applied to Kimai 0.9 and before. You can ignore it if you are using Kimai 1.0 or above!

You can adjust the permissions in your [local.yaml]({% link _documentation/configurations.md %}). 
Define the permissions like we did in the above mentioned example, 
you should start by copying the default permissions from `kimai.yaml`.

Be aware: if you configure your own permission definition, you have to overwrite the complete 
node (`sets`, `maps` or`roles`) that you edited and define all SETS and/or ROLES.

**Be aware**
There are other business rules which might limit access to certain functionalities, so these permissions are not the only checks in place.
For example timesheet records which were exported cannot be edited any longer, even if a user has the "edit_own_timesheet" or "edit_other_timesheet" permission. 

### Existing sets

Existing sets can be seen in `kimai.yaml`. I will not go into details here, as their customization 
is generally not necessary.

You cannot extend existing sets, if you define them, they will be overwritten with your config.
Therefor it is **not** recommended to overwrite any existing `set` but create new ones. 
Please start their name with a prefix like 'CUSTOM_':
```yaml
kimai:
    permissions:
        sets:
            CUSTOM_ROLE_USER: ['@ROLE_USER', '@TAGS']
        maps:
            ROLE_USER: ['CUSTOM_ROLE_USER']
```

### Existing maps

By default each role owns only one set, which is called like the user role itself:

```yaml
kimai:
    permissions:
        maps:
            ROLE_USER: ['ROLE_USER']
            ROLE_TEAMLEAD: ['ROLE_TEAMLEAD']
            ROLE_ADMIN: ['ROLE_ADMIN']
            ROLE_SUPER_ADMIN: ['ROLE_SUPER_ADMIN']
```
