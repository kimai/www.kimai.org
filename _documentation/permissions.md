Kimai 2 provides a flexible permissions system, which is based on [user roles]({% link _documentation/users.md %}) and permissions, 
which can be turned on and off for these roles. You need the `role_permissions` permission to access it.

This permission system limits access to the functionality of Kimai. If you are looking for a way to limit access to  
timesheets, activities, projects and customers read the [Team permission documentation]({% link _documentation/teams.md %}).

**Be aware**
There are other business rules which might limit access to certain functions, so these permissions are not the only checks in place.
For example timesheet records which were exported cannot be edited any longer, even if a user has the `edit_own_timesheet` 
or `edit_other_timesheet` permission. 

## Plugin permissions

Developer can add/change permissions through plugins, see [Developers documentation]({% link _documentation/developers.md %}).

## Permission configuration in local.yaml

Since Kimai 1.6 there is generally no reason for changing the default permission through the [local.yaml]({% link _documentation/configurations.md %}).
It can be considered bad practice, as it can lead to problems with future updates.

### Understanding permission structure

Before you learn to configure the permission system, you have to understand the three involved config types:

1. `Permission sets` - a re-usable mapping of a free choosable name (e.g. `TEST`) to a list of: 
  - one or more "permission names" (e.g. `test`)
  - one or more "permission sets" (linking other sets can be achieved by prepending an `@`, e.g. `@TEST`)
  - one or more "negated permission names" (prepend an `!` to negate a permission, e.g. `!test`)
2. `Permission maps` - a mapping of a role name to a list of "permission sets" (no `@` required here, e.g. `TEST`)
3. `Permissions` - a mapping of a role name to a list of:
  - one or more "permission names" (e.g. `test`)
  - one or more "negated permission names" (e.g. `!test`)

An example and its explanation:

```yaml
    permissions:
        sets:
            ACTIVITY: ['view_activity', 'create_activity']
            TIMESHEET: ['view_own_timesheet', 'start_own_timesheet']
            PROFILE: ['my_profile', 'show_roles', 'other_profiles']
            EXAMPLE: ['@PROFILE', '@ACTIVITY']
            EXAMPLE_USER: ['@PROFILE', '!show_roles']
        maps:
            ROLE_USER: ['TIMESHEET', 'EXAMPLE_USER']
            ROLE_ADMIN: ['TIMESHEET', 'EXAMPLE']
        roles:
            ROLE_USER: ['!other_profiles']
            ROLE_ADMIN: ['delete_activity']
```

- In `sets` we define the `permissions sets` names "ACTIVITY", "TIMESHEET", "PROFILE" and "EXAMPLE".
- The `set` called "EXAMPLE" inherits the other `sets` called "PROFILE" and "ACTIVITY", so its contains 
the permissions: my_profile, show_roles, other_profiles, view_activity , create_activity.
- The `set` called "EXAMPLE_USER" inherits the `set` called "PROFILE" and removes the permission "show_roles", so its contains 
the permissions: my_profile, other_profiles.
 
In `maps` we now apply the `permission set` called "TIMESHEET" and "EXAMPLE_USER" to the user-role "ROLE_USER" 
and the two `permission sets` called "TIMESHEET" and "EXAMPLE" to the user-role "ROLE_ADMIN".

At this step the roles have the following permissions:

- `ROLE_USER` - view_own_timesheet, start_own_timesheet, my_profile, other_profiles
- `ROLE_ADMIN` - view_own_timesheet, start_own_timesheet, my_profile, show_roles, other_profiles, view_activity, create_activity

As last step, the list of `permission names` will be merged with the list of previously calculated permissions.
We removed the permission "other_profiles" from the user-role "ROLE_USER" and added the permission "delete_activity" to the user-role "ROLE_ADMIN".

At the end the system calculated the final list of permissions:  

- `ROLE_USER` - view_own_timesheet, start_own_timesheet, my_profile
- `ROLE_ADMIN` - view_own_timesheet, start_own_timesheet, my_profile, show_roles, other_profiles, view_activity, create_activity, delete_activity

Yes, that could have been easier ;-) but I wanted to demonstrate all possibilities!

### Changing permissions

In most cases you just want to adjust single permissions, like remove from or add single permissions to a user role. 
This can be done by adding something like this to your [local.yaml]({% link _documentation/configurations.md %}):

```yaml
kimai:
    permissions:
        roles:
            ROLE_TEAMLEAD: ['!edit_invoice_template', 'delete_invoice_template']
```
This example removes `edit_invoice_template` and adds `delete_invoice_template` for the user role `ROLE_TEAMLEAD`.

If you want to go further and want to re-adjust which `sets` are applied to a user role, you have to overwrite the 
complete map for that role. Lets assume you want to redefine user permissions and allow full access to tags, 
then you edit your `local.yaml` like this:

```yaml
kimai:
    permissions:
        maps:
            ROLE_USER: ['ROLE_USER', 'TAGS']
```
As you overwrite the default map `ROLE_USER` by defining it, you have to apply the default set `ROLE_USER` and append the set `TAGS` (see below in "Existing maps").

Customizing sets is generally not recommended, as you should be able to achieve everything with `maps` and `permissions`. 
See below in "Existing sets". 

### Existing sets

Existing sets can be seen in `kimai.yaml`, their customization is generally not necessary. 
You cannot extend existing sets, if you define them, they will be overwritten with your config.
Therefor it is **not** recommended to overwrite any existing `set` but create new ones (start their name with a prefix like 'CUSTOM_'):
```yaml
kimai:
    permissions:
        sets:
            CUSTOM_ROLE_USER: ['@ROLE_USER', '@TAGS']
        maps:
            ROLE_USER: ['CUSTOM_ROLE_USER']
```

### Existing maps

By default each role owns only one set, which is called like the user role itself:

```yaml
kimai:
    permissions:
        maps:
            ROLE_USER: ['ROLE_USER']
            ROLE_TEAMLEAD: ['ROLE_TEAMLEAD']
            ROLE_ADMIN: ['ROLE_ADMIN']
            ROLE_SUPER_ADMIN: ['ROLE_SUPER_ADMIN']
```
