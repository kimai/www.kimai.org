title: Roles & Permissions
description: Configure the permission system which is based on user roles 
toc: true

Kimai provides a flexible permission system, which is based on **user roles** and **permissions**, 
which can be turned on and off for these roles. You need the `role_permissions` permission to access the `Roles` screen.

This permission system limits access to the functionality of Kimai. If you are looking for a way to limit access to  
timesheets, activities, projects and customers read about [Team permissions]({% link _documentation/teams.md %}). 

## Roles

Access to functions are handled by the [permission system]({% link _documentation/permissions.md %}), which is configurable through user roles.
There are four pre-defined roles in Kimai, which have a pre-made set of ACLs/permissions.

| Role name      | Description                                                                                                                                               |
|----------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| User           | Normal user can track their working times, see basic reports and change their own preferences. Technical name: `ROLE_USER`                                |
| Teamlead       | Manages [teams]({% link _documentation/teams.md %}) with permissions for invoices and access to all **team** timesheets. Technical name: `ROLE_TEAMLEAD`  |
| Administrator  | Can manage all content and timesheet related data, but lack user administration and system privileges. Technical name: `ROLE_ADMIN`                       |
| System-Admin   | Has permissions to manage everything in Kimai, from content to timesheets to users, plugins and system configurations. Technical name: `ROLE_SUPER_ADMIN` |

{% include alert.html type="success" alert="Every user is automatically member of the ROLE_USER, this behaviour cannot be changed." %}

### Creating roles

If the pre-defined roles are not sufficient for your use-case and you need more roles, you can create new ones.

Every user with the permission `role_permissions` can create new user roles. 
There is a button that will open a new modal, to enter a role name. This new role will show up in the table after saving.

{% include alert.html type="warning" alert="Allowed character are: `A-Z` and `_`. If you use different character, you might experience strange bugs." %}

## Permissions 

By turning permissions `on` and `off` for specific roles, you widen or limit the access to certain features.
Clicking the `Yes` and `No` labels in the table toggles the selected permission (row title) for the respective role (column title).

### Existing permissions

**Be aware**
There are other business rules which might limit access to certain functions, so these permissions are not the only checks in place.
For example timesheet records which were exported cannot be edited any longer, even if a user has the `edit_own_timesheet` 
or `edit_other_timesheet` permission.
