The Kimai dashboard displays (so called) `widgets`.
The ones shipped by default can be changed, re-ordered or completely removed.

The dashboard can be configured directly by the user via the frontend, every user can have an own set of widgets.

Some widget might require certain permissions to access the data, so different user roles see different widgets.

Upon clicking the {% include demo-action-button.html icon="bx bx-cog" title="Preferences" %} button in the top right corner, you can configure the dashboard.
