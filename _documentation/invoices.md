Kimai allows to create invoices from timesheet data in several formats. 

## Invoice document

The invoice system currently supports the following formats:

- `HTML`
  - through the use of Twig templates
  - filename must end with `.html.twig` 
  - Pros: no need for additional software, print or convert to PDF from your browser (if supported)
- `DOCX`
  - OOXML - Open Office XML Text
  - Microsoft Word 2007-2013 XML
  - filename must end with `.docx` 
  - Pros: simple customization and possibility to edit the invoice later on
  - our recommended invoice document format
- `CSV`
  - Comma-separated file with UTF-8 encoding and double-quotes around each field 
  - filename must end with `.csv` 
  - Pros: good for exporting and creating enhanced reports with an office software package
  - our recommended export format
- `XLSX`
  - Microsoft Excelâ„¢ 2007 shipped with a new file format, namely Microsoft Office Open XML SpreadsheetML, and Excel 2010 extended this still further with new features. 
  - file extension: filename must end with `.xlsx` 
  - PRO: good for exporting, creating enhanced reports with an office software package
- `ODS`
  - Open Document Spreadsheet or OASIS, is the OpenOffice.org XML file format for spreadsheets supported by OpenOffice, LibreOffice, StarCalc, Microsoft and others 
  - file extension: filename must end with `.ods` 
  - Pros: open format - good for exporting, creating enhanced reports with an office software package
  - our recommended spreadsheet format

**Be aware**: the default templates were created and tested ONLY with LibreOffice!

## Export state

Invoices and exports share the export state, which is used to mark timesheet records a processed. 
These records cannot be edited any longer by regular users and are excluded by default from further invoices and exports.
 
For further information read the [timesheet documentation]({% link _documentation/timesheet.md %}).

## Create your own invoice document

Invoice documents are searched in two locations:

- `templates/invoice/renderer/`
- `var/invoices/`

Be aware of the following rules:

- Documents are addressed by their filename without extension (e.g. `kimai.html.twig` results in `kimai`) 
- You can use every document name only once: so having `kimai.html.twig` and `kimai.docx` will lead to unpredictable results 
- The first file to be found takes precedence 
- Kimai looks first in `var/invoices/`, so you can overwrite default templates
- You should store your templates in `var/invoices/` as this directory is not shipped with Kimai and not touched during updates
- You can configure different search directories through the config key `kimai.invoice.documents` if you want to 
  - hide the default templates
  - add additional template source directories
  - see below in `Configure search path` to find out how
- After you created a new or updated an existing template, you might have to clear the cache with `bin/console cache:clear` to see the results

### Twig templates

If you are looking for a way to set the advanced contact data, see below in _Configure contact data_.

Generally speaking, you should use only the variable `model` in your template which is an instance of `App\Model\InvoiceModel`.

Please see the [default templates]({{ site.kimai_v2_file }}/templates/invoice/renderer) at 
GitHub to find out which variables can be used or debug it with:

```twig
{% raw %}{{ dump(model) }}{% endraw %}
```

The `dump()` method is only available in `dev` environment, check your `.env` if you are unsure. 

If you want more examples of the available methods for a timesheet record, you can have a look in the other existing templates, 
like [the template which renders the "My times" page]({{ site.kimai_v2_file }}/templates/timesheet/index.html.twig).

### Docx templates

Docx templates are powered by [PHPWord](https://github.com/PHPOffice/PHPWord) and its `TemplateProcessor`.

**Important:** You have to add one of the variables - either `${entry.description}` or `${entry.row}` - in one table row, 
otherwise the rendering process will fail! The row containing this variable will be cloned for every included timesheet record.

If you do not use `${entry.description}` then a fallback for `${entry.row}` is used and will be removed in the rendering process, 
it will not show up in the generated invoice.

See below in `Template variables` to find out which variables you can use in your template.

Find out more about PHPWord templates [here](https://phpword.readthedocs.io/en/latest/templates-processing.html).

### Spreadsheets (ODS, XLSX and CSV)

Spreadsheet templates are powered by [PhpSpreadsheet](https://github.com/PHPOffice/PhpSpreadsheet).

**Important:** within the first 100 rows you MUST-HAVE the template row for timesheet entries, which means there must be 
a value starting with `${entry.` in one of the first 10 columns, otherwise no timesheet records will be rendered!

_Check the default templates if that doesn't make sense to you ;-)_

This row will then be cloned for every timesheet entry. 

See below in `Template variables` to find out which variables you can use in your CSV file.

## Template variables

Be aware, that the following list of variables is only working for the "document" based formats, but NOT for twig templates. 
Twig templates are rendered actively, it is up to the developer to calculate what is needed.  

### Global variables 

The documents which are rendered passively (ODS, XLSX, CSV, DOCX) can use the following global variables:

## Configure search path

An example configuration in [local.yaml]({% link _documentation/configurations.md %}) might look like this:

```yaml
kimai:
    invoice:
        documents:
            - 'var/invoices/'
```

This would disable the default documents, as Kimai will only look in the directory `var/invoices/` for files.

## Configure contact data

Some HTML invoice templates need additional data, that can't be edited through the UI.
These values should be added to your [local.yaml]({% link _documentation/configurations.md %}):
```yaml
twig:
    globals:
        company:
            name: 'Kimai Inc.',
            homepage: 'www.kimai.org',
            email: 'kimai@example.com',
            phone: '0123-4567890',
            tax_number: 'YourTaxNumber',
            signature: '/build/images/signature.png',
            address: 'Kimai Inc.
                Example road 42
                D â€“ 12345 City
            ',
            bank_account: '
                Kimai Inc.
                IBAN: DE00 0000 0000 0000 0000 00
                BIC: XXXXXXXX (a bank name)
            '
```
