title: Data removal
description: We protect your privacy by deleting unused data after a certain period of time. Only applies to free accounts! 
---

I do not make any money from your private data and for data minimisation reasons,
unused free accounts will be irretrievably deleted after a waiting period!

You can prevent deletion by using your time-tracker at regular intervals.

### Why data is deleted

Many people quietly accept that using the internet is a threat to their privacy; that their private information is sold for money and abused by Big Tech.
Not with me: I don't do that. I fight against it! I do everything I can to protect your privacy.
One of our strongest weapons in protecting your privacy is deleting your data when you're no longer using it.

I believe that **deleting unused data is the best way to prove to everyone that collecting user accounts is not part of the business**.
I want to provide you with a safe working environment. Privacy first is one of my top rules.
There is no investor behind me, so I do not have and do not want to fake numbers with expired accounts! I do make my own rules.

And one of these rules is: **You must log in once a month and enter a time record.**

If you don't follow this rule, you will receive a warning that "Your cloud is unused".
After receiving this email, you have max. 4 weeks to log in and enter a timesheet.
If you fail to do so, your cloud will be irretrievable/permanently deleted.

**This process only applies to free users.** Paying customers pay me to host Kimai - their data is protected and will never be touched.

### Missing your login / cloud?

You can ask for details, but unfortunately there is no way I can provide them.
If you don't use Kimai, your data will be completely deleted (hello GDPR).
I don't know if you had an account in the past.
If it is not there, but you are sure it existed, then it has been removed by our privacy processes.

**You can always register a new account and new cloud if you wish.**
But please make sure that you read the system-emails next time.
I don't spam, you just get important updates about your cloud.

Unsubscribing from our system emails is not only a bad idea, it's a violation of the TOS.

### Warning emails

Kimai will send you warning emails that your cloud is unused with more information if the following applies:

- after the trial period has expired
- last login was more than 30 days ago
- the last timesheet was created more than 30 days ago

If you don't need your Kimai cloud anymore, you don't have to do anything: four weeks after sending the warning-email,
your cloud and your account will be completely deleted.

### Data protection for paying customer

Data for paying accounts is secure.

Paying customers are protected and their data will never be touched by this process.
