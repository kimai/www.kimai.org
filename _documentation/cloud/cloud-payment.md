description: How to pay your Kimai Cloud subscription - payment methods, billing period, trial period and more
---

You can utilize the test phase and the free plan without providing any payment information. However, this must be done before subscribing to a paid plan.

### SEPA Direct Debit

Customers with a European bank account can authorize a SEPA direct debit mandate.

### Credit Cards

We accept major credit cards including **Visa, Mastercard, American Express, Discover, Diners**, and others.

### Payment

#### Starter and Professional Plans

These are prepaid plans. You select the number of licenses you need and pay for them upfront.

If additional licenses are required, you can purchase them at any time. The cost is prorated, meaning you only pay for the remaining time in the current subscription period.

You may cancel your contract up to the last day before the subscription period ends. Once your subscription expires, no further invoices will be issued.

#### Plus and Premium Plans (Deprecated)

These plans were deprecated in January 2024 and are no longer available for new subscriptions. P
ricing is based on the plan and the number of registered users. 
You can adjust the number of users at any time, and billing for Kimai-Cloud occurs **in arrears**: invoices are issued at the end of each billing period.

Refer to "User-Based Billing" below for more details.

If you cancel your contract, a final invoice will be issued after your subscription expires.

### Billing Period

Billing occurs on a monthly or annual basis, with the billing date corresponding to the date the plan was initially subscribed. 
For example, if you subscribe to the premium plan on December 26th, subsequent invoices will be issued on the 26th of each month.

If you require billing on specific dates (e.g., the first of the month), please subscribe on that date or contact support for assistance.

### Trial Period

For an extended trial period or additional trial users, please contact support.

### EU Reverse-Charge and Taxes

Kimai Cloud operates under "Electronically Provided Services / Data Processing," applying the **Receiver Location Principle**.

- The tax regulations of {{ site.cloud.country }} apply.
- A valid VAT ID is necessary to issue an EU reverse-charge invoice.
- The tax number you provide will always appear on your invoice.

**Kimai Cloud is specifically designed for B2B customers.**

- Business customers within the EU with a VAT ID will receive reverse-charge invoices.
- Our business is based in Austria; therefore, Austrian customers will always receive an invoice including tax.
- Customers from other EU countries without a VAT ID will receive invoices with their local VAT rate (under the OSS / One-Stop Shop program).

### How Payment Data is Stored

We partner with "Stripe" to securely manage your payment data. Your payment details (credit card number and CVC/check digits or IBAN for SEPA) are **never** transmitted to Kimai's server.

Stripe has anonymous access to certain data for informational and fraud prevention purposes:
- The card issuer (CC) or bank details (SEPA), including country
- Expiration date (CC)
- Last four digits of the card (CC) or IBAN (SEPA)

### User Licenses

Typically, each registered user of Kimai Cloud incurs a charge, but we prioritize fairness:

- **Active users** consume one license.
- **Deactivated users** do not consume a license. Once deactivated, a license becomes available for another account. If a previously deactivated user is reactivated, a license is consumed again.

If you lack sufficient licenses to create a new account or activate an existing one, additional licenses can be purchased at [My Cloud](https://www.kimai.cloud/my-cloud/).

### User-Based Billing

Accounts still using the deprecated **metered plans** `Plus` and `Premium` follow a different billing model (these plans are not available for new customers).

- **Active users incur charges**
- Deactivated users incur charges **if they have been active within the last month**, such as:
    - The user was registered within the last month
    - The user logged in within the last month
    - The user made a time booking within the last month (or later)
