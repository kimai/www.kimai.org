### Timesheets

This will import timesheets and create these elements on the fly:
- missing customer
- missing projects
- missing activities

Users need to exist before (mainly because the user timezone setting will be used to import the timesheets).

#### Example

```csv
"Date","From","To","Duration","Rate","User","Customer","Project","Activity","Description","Exported","Tags","Hourly rate","Fixed rate"
"2020-05-04","15:50","17:51","7260","231.92","user@example.com","Customer LLC","My project", "Testing","some work has been done","0","foo,bar","115.00","0"
```

- Date: format `Y-m-d`
- From and To: should be given in 24h format
- Duration: in seconds
- Rate: A floating number of the records rate (optional, if you don't set the value it will be calculated)
- Hourly Rate: A floating number for the hourly rate (optional, if you don't set the value it will be calculated)
- Fixed Rate: A floating number for the fixed rate of this record (optional, you can skip this column)
- Customer, Project and Activity: will be matched by name
- User: will be matched by username or email
- Exported: can be `0` or `1` (0 = new, 1 = exported)
- Tags: comma separated list of tag names

### Customer from Grandtotal

There is a [plugin for Mac invoicing software Grandtotal]({% link _store/keleo-grandtotal-plugin-for-kimai.md %}), which adds support for Kimai.

In case your leading system for customers is Grandtotal, you can import customers from a Grandtotal CSV export into Kimai.
Grandtotal calls CSV exports `Numbers` in the export screen.

Attention: Grandtotal exports its data with column names in the UI language (just like Kimai).
Kimai only supports imports for GT exports from the languages english and german, so you might have to change it in `Settings / Languages / User interface`.

### Permissions

| Permission Name | Description                                           |
|-----------------|-------------------------------------------------------|
| importer        | access the administration screen to import CSV files  |
{: .table }

By default, these are assigned to each user with the role `ROLE_SUPER_ADMIN`.
