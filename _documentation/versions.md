Some people struggle to understand the versioning of Kimai.
That usually happens, when the app number and version number are mixed.

There are two distinct Kimai versions with totally different code bases.
So the app name might sometimes contain the number 1 or 2. 
This usually relates to the "original" Kimai, which we call `Kimai 1` sometimes (see the last image on this page).

The modern Kimai is sometimes called `Kimai 2`, but only if we need to differentiate between the original and the current Kimai.
We use it on this page to explain this concept, but whenever we say `Kimai` we mean `Kimai 2`.

The following list is ordered from youngest to oldest version.

## Kimai 2

This Kimai version was originally released in 2018 and is still actively developed today.

Released versions were 0.2 up to {{ site.kimai_v2_version }}.
That means there are multiple major versions existing, which combined from the app name part `2` and the actual release number like `1.30` or `2.0.22` leads to:
- `Kimai 2 - v1.30`
- `Kimai 2 - v2.0.22`
- `Kimai 1.30`
- `Kimai 2.0.22`

### 2.0

Based on Tabler and Symfony 6:

[![Kimai 2.0 - Login]({% link images/screenshots/login-2.jpg %})]({% link images/screenshots/login-2.jpg %})

[![Kimai 2.0 - Dashboard]({% link images/screenshots/dashboard-2.jpg %})]({% link images/screenshots/dashboard-2.jpg %})

### 1.0

Based on AdminLTE and Symfony 4:

[![Kimai 1.0 - Login]({% link images/screenshots/login-1.jpg %})]({% link images/screenshots/login-1.jpg %})

[![Kimai 1.0 - Dashboard]({% link images/screenshots/dashboard-1.jpg %})]({% link images/screenshots/dashboard-1.jpg %})

## Kimai 1

This Kimai version was originally released in 2007 and actively developed until 2018.

The latest available version was called v1.3.2 (released September 2019). 

It looked like this:

[![Kimai 1 - Login]({% link images/screenshots/kimai1-login.png %})]({% link images/screenshots/kimai1-login.png %})

[![Kimai 1 - Dashboard]({% link images/screenshots/kimai1-main-screen.png %})]({% link images/screenshots/kimai1-main-screen.png %})
