A Kimai plugin is from a technical perspective _only_ a Symfony bundle, with some minor modifications.

Within the external communication it is called **plugin** instead of **bundle**, as this is the wording most users know. 

## Kimai plugins vs. pure Symfony bundles

The reason for using a slightly different approach than the proposed Symfony way is the recommended way 
to install and update Kimai with Git and Composer.

If you would install a bundle using composer, you would end up with a "dirty git status" and run 
into problems when performing the next update (with changes in: `bundles.php`, `composer.json`, `composer.lock`, `symfony.lock`).

The application Kernel was slightly modified to allow dynamic plugin and route loading, to prevent this from happening.

## Plugin location

Kimai plugins are stored in `var/plugins/`, for example `var/plugins/YourBundle/`.
The contents in `var/plugins/*` are listed in the [.gitignore]({{ site.kimai_v2_file }}/.gitignore) file to prevent update problems.

### Plugin installation

Due to the changed plugin location, installation should be done with `git clone` (recommended way) or with a copy task, 
but composer can be used as well (leading to the mentioned update problems).

## Difference between Kimai plugin and Symfony bundle

There are some differences to Symfony bundles, which were added to prevent the above mentioned update problems:

- Kimai plugins are stored in `var/plugins/` instead of `vendor/`
- Kimai plugins are loaded automatically in **each** environment (don't modify `config/bundles.php`)
- Routes are automatically loaded with the search pattern:  
`var/plugins/YourBundle/Resources/config/routes.{php,xml,yaml,yml}`
- Your Bundle class needs to be namespaced with the vendor segment `KimaiPlugin`
- Your Bundle must implement `App\Plugin\PluginInterface` 

The namespace is pre-registered in composer with the vendor segment locked to `KimaiPlugin`, 
pointing to `var/plugins/` to prevent that users have to dump a new autoloader after installing a plugin. 

## Directory structure

The minimal directory structure must look like this:

```
var/plugins/YourBundle
├── DependencyInjection
│   └── YourExtension.php
├── Resources
│   └── config
│       └── services.yaml
├── YourBundle.php
├── composer.json
└ ... more files and directories follow here ... 
```

Even though its called **plugin** in Kimai, the namespace and classes still need to follow the official 
[Symfony bundle naming conventions](https://symfony.com/doc/current/bundles/best_practices.html#bundles-naming-conventions). 

### YourBundle.php

```php
namespace KimaiPlugin\YourBundle;

use App\Plugin\PluginInterface;
use Symfony\Component\DependencyInjection\ContainerBuilder;
use Symfony\Component\HttpKernel\Bundle\Bundle;

class YourBundle extends Bundle implements PluginInterface
{
}
```

### DependencyInjection/YourExtension.php

```php
namespace KimaiPlugin\YourBundle\DependencyInjection;

use Symfony\Component\Config\FileLocator;
use Symfony\Component\DependencyInjection\ContainerBuilder;
use Symfony\Component\DependencyInjection\Loader;
use Symfony\Component\HttpKernel\DependencyInjection\Extension;

class YourExtension extends Extension
{
    public function load(array $configs, ContainerBuilder $container)
    {
        try {
            $loader = new Loader\YamlFileLoader($container, new FileLocator(__DIR__ . '/../Resources/config'));
            $loader->load('services.yaml');
        } catch (\Exception $e) {
            echo '[YourBundle] invalid services config found: ' . $e->getMessage();
        }
    }
}
```

### Resources/config/services.yaml

```yaml
services:
    _defaults:
        autowire: true
        autoconfigure: true
        public: false
        bind:

    KimaiPlugin\YourBundle\:
        resource: '../../*'
        exclude: '../../{Resources}'
```

### composer.json

Your plugin needs to ship a composer.json, even if it is not used for installation.
Kimai will read values from it for extended information in the plugins admin panel.

A minimal `composer.json` could look like this:

```json
{
    "name": "foo/your-bundle",
    "description": "A Kimai 2 demo plugin which does nothing",
    "homepage": "https://www.kimai.org/",
    "type": "kimai-plugin",
    "version": "0.1",
    "require": {
        "kimai/kimai2-composer": "*"
    },
    "license": "MIT",
    "authors": [
        {
            "name": "Kevin Papst",
            "email": "kpapst@gmx.net",
            "homepage": "https://www.kimai.org"
        }
    ],
    "extra": {
        "kimai": {
            "require": "1.3",
            "version": "0.1",
            "name": "YourBundle"
        }
    }
}
```

The `type` (kimai-plugin)is required for proper installation if composer is used, as well as the `require` package `kimai/kimai2-composer`.
The `homepage` will be used for a backlink in the admin panel. 

The values in the `extra.kimai` section are used for:

- `require` - the required (minimal) Kimai which is needed for this plugin  
- `version` - the version of this plugin
- `name` - the name of the plugin, used as target directory name of your bundle

## Data storage

When your plugin wants to store files, don't use your plugin directory or concat the directory yourself, but 
use the ServiceContainer parameter `%kimai.data_dir%`. This is currently pointing to `var/data/` and also protected 
from the above mentioned update problems via [.gitignore]({{ site.kimai_v2_file }}/.gitignore). 

As this could change in the future, always inject the data directory instead of finding a place yourself:   

```yaml
services:
    KimaiPlugin\YourBundle\MyController:
        arguments:
            $dataDirectory: "%kimai.data_dir%"
```

There is another parameter called `%kimai.plugin_dir%`, which is pointing to the base directory of all plugins.

## Example plugin

Please have a look at the [CustomCSSBundle](https://github.com/keleo/CustomCSSBundle) which serves as bundle demo:
- A bundle with an extension to load service definitions
- Additional routes
- An admin controller with form usage, flash messages and an additional view
- EventSubscriber to extend the navigation
- Translations
- Data storage in `%kimai.data_dir%`

## List your plugin in the {{ site.data.trans[page.lang].store }}

If you created a plugin or any other kind of software around Kimai 2 which you want to see listed in the {{ site.data.trans[page.lang].store }}, head over 
to the [{{ site.data.trans[page.lang].store }} documentation]({% link _documentation/store.md %}) to find out how.
