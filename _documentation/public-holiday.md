## Groups

If you have employees in different locations with different sets of public holidays, you need to create groups for them.

But if you have only one office with all employees having the same set of used public holidays, you can use the "Default" group and skip this step.

## Permissions

The `contract_other_profile` permission is required to see the `Contract` menu, which includes the `Public holiday` management view.
