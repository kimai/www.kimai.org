If you create a plugin or any other kind of software around Kimai, 
which you want to see listed in the [{{ site.data[page.lang].translation.store.name}}]({% link _pages/store.html %}), follow these short guidelines.

The website is generated with [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com) and [managed at GitHub]({{ site.kimai_v2_website }}).
It is translated to many languages, and there is a little more work required than just adding a markdown page. 
But not much ... and it just needs a couple of minutes! You'll get help at GitHub if something doesn't work.

## Adding a plugin

Let's assume your developer prefix is `acme` and your item name is `foo`. 

1. Add your developer/company information to the `_data/developer.yml` file (see below `Developer information`):
```yaml
acme:
  name: Acme company
  username: acme
  photo:
  profile: "#"
```
2. Create a store file definition at `_data/store/acme-foo.yml` for your item  (see below `Product information`):
```yaml
developer: acme
icon: fas fa-home
price: 0
bundle:
    name: "FooBundle"
    clone: "https://github.com/acme/foo.git"
    versions:
        - [ "2.0", "2.0" ]
```
3. Copy and paste `_store/keleo-custom-content-bundle.md` to `_store/acme-foo.md` and change:
```
title: Foo
type: plugin
```
You also need to replace `{% raw %}{% include store/keleo-custom-content-bundle.md %}{% endraw %}` with some introductory text for your new item.
4. Create a translation for your plugin in `_data/en/store.yaml`:
```yaml
items:
  acme-foo:
      title: Foo â€” a cool plugin for Kimai
      intro: A longer introduction between approx. 100 and 180 character 
```
5. Run `php translate-pages.php`. This will extract your content into an include and then create a store page for every language.

## Developer information

The information about yourself or your company comes from the [developer.yml file]({{ site.kimai_v2_website }}/tree/main/_data/developer.yml).

It starts by defining your company/developer ID and then adding the following keys:

- `name` - your company or personal name (**mandatory**)
- `description` - a short self-description in one sentence (**mandatory**)
- `image` - full URL to your company logo or avatar (**mandatory**)
- `homepage` - full URL to your website (optional)
- `github` - your GitHub organization or profile URL (optional)
- `twitter` - full URL to your twitter profile (optional)

The ID should be built from the lowercased version of your name: use only alphabetical character and remove all special chars and spaces.

For example, my own entry (`kevinpapst` being my developer ID):

```
kevinpapst:
    name: Kevin Papst
    description: Freelancer, PHP professional and Kimai core developer since 2007

    homepage: https://www.kevinpapst.de
    github: https://github.com/kevinpapst
    twitter: https://twitter.com/keleo
```

## Product information

Create a new markdown file in the [_store directory]({{ site.kimai_v2_website }}/tree/main/_store/), follow the filename pattern:
`company-short-descriptive-name.md`

Within the Jekyll [Front Matter](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/front-matter/) you have the following attributes available:

- `name` - a name for your {{ site.data[page.lang].translation.store.name}} entry will be used in the list view and in the title of the detail screen (**mandatory**)
- `intro` - a descriptive sentence for this entry will be used in the detail screen (**mandatory**)
- `developer` - your company/developer ID (**mandatory**)
- `date` - date of the last release (**mandatory**)
- `image` - product image (optional)
- `icon` - fontawesome icon class (optional, but should be given when no image is supplied - a fallback icon will be used if not given)
- `price` - the item price (optional, if not given explain pricing structure in the full-text)
- `version` - last release version (optional)
- `download` - full URL to the download if available (optional)
- `documentation` - slug to your (optional) documentation page
- `github` - full URL to the GitHub project (optional)
- `screenshot` - full URL to an image / screenshot (optional)
- `new` - indicates that the {{ site.data[page.lang].translation.store.name}} item is new, represents a visible state in the shop (set to `true` - this will be removed after a while) (optional)
- `featured` - a boolean indicating if this item will be featured in the {{ site.data[page.lang].translation.store.name}} (decision is done by the project maintainer) 
- `features` - array with up to 6 features (short description with approx. 5 words each, currently only shown in the list view if `featured` is `true`) (optional) 
- `tags` - array with up to 4 tag, try to stay in the range of existing tags if applicable (optional)

A full example can be seen in the file [keleo-css-custom-bundle.md]({{ site.kimai_v2_website }}/tree/main/_store/keleo-css-custom-bundle.md).
