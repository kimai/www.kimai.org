Kimai supports authentication via a SAML provider of your choice (for now it was tested with G Suite and MS Azure accounts). 
SAML users will be imported during the first login with their attributes and groups. 

## Installation

In order to use the SAML authentication, you have to add configurations changes to your 
[local.yaml]({% link _documentation/configurations.md %}) (this example is for G Suite accounts):

```yaml
security:
    firewalls:
        secured_area:
            kimai_saml: ~

kimai:
    saml:
        activate: true
        title: Login with Google
        mapping:
            - { saml: $Email, kimai: email }
            - { saml: $FirstName $LastName, kimai: alias }
        roles:
            attribute: Roles
            mapping:
                - { saml: Admins, kimai: ROLE_ADMIN }
                - { saml: Management, kimai: ROLE_TEAMLEAD }
        connection:
            # You SAML provider, here an example for Google
            idp:
                entityId: 'https://accounts.google.com/o/saml2?idpid=your-google-id'
                singleSignOnService:
                    url: 'https://accounts.google.com/o/saml2/idp?idpid=your-google-id'
                    binding: 'urn:oasis:names:tc:SAML:2.0:bindings:HTTP-Redirect'
                # google does not support single logout, so it needs to be commented
                # the "single logout" feature was not yet tested, if you want to help, please let me know!
                #singleLogoutService:
                #    url: 'https://127.0.0.1:8010/logout'
                #    binding: 'urn:oasis:names:tc:SAML:2.0:bindings:HTTP-Redirect'

            # Your Kimai instance, replace https://127.0.0.1:8010 with your base URL
            sp:
                entityId: 'https://127.0.0.1:8010/auth/saml/metadata'
                assertionConsumerService:
                    url: 'https://127.0.0.1:8010/auth/saml/acs'
                    binding: 'urn:oasis:names:tc:SAML:2.0:bindings:HTTP-POST'
                singleLogoutService:

                    url: 'https://www.kimai.org'
```  

After changing the configuration you need to re-build the cache as described in the [configurations chapter]({% link _documentation/configurations.md %}). 

## Configuration details

```yaml
kimai:
    saml:
        activate: true
        title: Login with Google
        mapping:
            - { saml: $Email, kimai: email }
            - { saml: $FirstName $LastName, kimai: alias }
        roles:
            attribute: Roles
            mapping:
                - { saml: Admins, kimai: ROLE_ADMIN }
                - { saml: Management, kimai: ROLE_TEAMLEAD }
```

A brief description of the available fields:
- `activate` (bool) activates the SAML authentication flow 
- `title` (string) the name of the red Login button in the authentication screen
- `mapping` (array) an array of attributes that will be synced with Kimai. The `kimai` value (`email` and `alias`) are the names in Kimai, the `saml` key (`$Email` and `$FirstName $LastName`) are the attributes from the SAML response. You can assign static values to every user (like `title` = `SAML User`) or you fetch one or more values from the SAML message (`$Email` refers to the SAML attribute `Email` and `$FirstName $LastName` refers to the two SAML attributes `$FirstName` and `$LastName`).
- `roles` (array) settings related to the user roles syncing
  - `attribute` (string) the SAML attribute whose values are used for syncing the groups
  - `mapping` (array) an array of role name mappings. The `saml` key is your SAML role name (here `Admins` and `Management`) and the key `kimai` (here `ROLE_ADMIN` and `ROLE_TEAMLEAD`) is the role name in Kimai. Unmapped roles from the SAML message will be IGNORED(!) even if they are existing in Kimai.  

{% include alert.html type="info" alert="User data and roles are synchronized during each login." %}
{% include alert.html type="info" alert="Every user automatically owns the ROLE_USER role, you don't have to create a mapping for it." %}
{% include alert.html type="warning" alert="Every user needs a username and email address, you cannot activate SAML without a mapping for the email. The username cannot be set from SAML attributes, but will always be taken from the SAML request." %}

### Connection details

You can find more information about the connection configs in the [onelogin/php-saml](https://github.com/onelogin/php-saml#how-it-works) library that is used for the SAML connections.

### G Suite and roles (or groups)

If you want to sync user-roles as well, you have to know that Google doesn't support that out-of-the-box. 
You need to setup additional user attributes and add those to the SAML attributes of your application.

- [Setup groups in G Suite](https://www.dynatrace.com/support/help/how-to-use-dynatrace/user-management-and-sso/manage-users-and-groups-with-saml/saml-gsuite/#preparing-group-mapping)
- [Creating custom attributes using the user schema](https://support.google.com/cloudidentity/answer/6327792?hl=en&ref_topic=7558947)

### Azure

For Azure, please check the [Azure SAML documentation]({% link _documentation/azure.md %})

## Known limitations

A manually registered user can login via SAML, but his account account is then migrated to **SAML only**, 
so he can't login via password any longer. 
Additional all configured SAML attributes will be applied. 
To change such an account back to "password login", you need to update the `auth` column in the `kimai2_users` table and set the value from `saml` to `kimai`.

## Using SAML only

Kimai does not support **SAML only** out of the box, but you can disable the normal login flow yb redirecting the URLs to the SAML login.

This is an example for Apache: 

```
RewriteEngine On
RewriteRule  /(..)/login /auth/saml/login [L,R=301]
```

## Troubleshooting

### Proxy and http vs https

**Error:**  
The response was received at `http://kimai-test.example.com/auth/saml/acs` instead of `https://kimai-test.example.com/auth/saml/acs`

**Solution:**  
Use the `baseurl` configuration and set it to `https://kimai-test.example.com/auth/saml/` (and flush the cache!)
