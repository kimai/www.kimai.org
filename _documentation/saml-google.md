Go back to general [SAML configuration]({% link _documentation/saml.md %}) for Kimai. 

SAML authentication with Keycloak accounts has proven to work with the following configurations.

## Group sync

If you want to sync user-roles as well, you have to know that Google has two different ways to do that.
You can either use Google Groups or [additional user attributes](https://support.google.com/cloudidentity/answer/6327792?hl=en&ref_topic=7558947).
We strongly recommend to use Google Groups, but you can create an additional multi-value user attribute as well. 
Both are described below in the Step-by-Step guide.

## Configuration

Please copy & paste the entire [SAML configuration]({% link _documentation/saml.md %}). 
Adjust the following keys with your Google / App specific settings: 

```yaml
kimai:
    saml:
        provider: google
        activate: true
        title: Login with Google
        mapping:
            - { saml: $Email, kimai: email }
            - { saml: $FirstName $LastName, kimai: alias }
            - { saml: $Title, kimai: title }
            - { saml: $AccountNumber, kimai: accountNumber }
        roles:
            resetOnLogin: true
            attribute: Groups
            mapping:
                - { saml: KIMAI ADMIN, kimai: ROLE_ADMIN }
                - { saml: KIMAI TEAMLEAD, kimai: ROLE_TEAMLEAD }
        connection:
            idp:
                entityId: 'https://accounts.google.com/o/saml2?idpid=your-google-id'
                singleSignOnService:
                    url: 'https://accounts.google.com/o/saml2/idp?idpid=your-google-id'
                x509cert: 'ADD YOUR CERTIFICATE HERE'
            # Your Kimai: replace https://www.example.com with your base URL
            sp:
                entityId: 'https://www.example.com/auth/saml/metadata'
                assertionConsumerService:
                    url: 'https://www.example.com/auth/saml/acs'
```

You have to adjust more keys, please read the main SAML configuration!

## Create and configure the SAML application

- Go to [https://admin.google.com/ac/apps/unified](https://admin.google.com/ac/apps/unified)
- Choose "Add app" followed by "Add custom SAML app"
- Choose your app name (e.g. "Kimai") and [add this image](http://www.kimai.org/images/apple-touch-icon.png)
- Copy & paste the values from the Google Step-by-Step (page 2) guide into your Kimai configuration:
    - `SSO-URL` into `Single Sign-On URL`
    - `Entity-ID` into `Entity ID`
    - `Certificate` into `X.509 Certificate`
- Configure and copy the Service Provider (`kimai.saml.connection.sp`) values to Google (page 3):
    - `connection.sp.assertionConsumerService.url` into `ACS-URL`
    - `connection.sp.entityId` into `Entity-ID`
    - Choose the `Name-ID Format`: "X509_SUBJECT"
    - Select the `Name-ID`: "Basic Information > Primary Email"
    - On page 4 `Attributes` you have to define the `User attribute` mapping like this (correct case is important):

    | Google directory attribute        | App attribute       |
    |-----------------------------------|---------------------|
    | Basic Information > Primary email | Email               |
    | Basic Information > First name    | FirstName           |
    | Basic Information > Last name     | LastName            |
    | Employee Details > Employee ID    | AccountNumber       |
    | Employee Details > Title          | Title               |
    {: .table }
- Back on the overview page: activate the new application for your users
- The last configuration step takes care of the `User role` mapping, which can be defined in two ways:
    - Using Google Groups (recommended):
        - Create Groups for the Kimai roles you want to apply under Directory > Groups
        - Apply these groups to your users
        - Go back to edit your SAML application and configure the optional group-membership:
            - Choose all groups you configured for Kimai and map them to the App-Attribute `Groups`
    - Using a custom attribute:
        - Create a [User defined attribute](https://admin.google.com/ac/customschema) called `SAML Group`
        - Add a field `KimaiRole` as text type with multi-value
        - Edit your users and apply the values within the new attribute:
            - The value `Kimai-System` maps to the Kimai role `System-Admin`
            - The value `Kimai-Admin` maps to the Kimai role `Administrator`
            - The value `Kimai-Teamlead` maps to the Kimai role `Teamlead`
        - Go back to edit your SAML application and configure one more attribute mapping:
            - The Google directory attribute `SAML Group > KimaiRole` to the App-Attribute `Groups`

You can use other names for your groups, the mapping happens in the next step in your Cloud configuration.

## Single Logout

Google does not support single logout, so it needs to be commented in the configuration.

The "single logout" feature was not yet tested, if you want to help, please let me know!
