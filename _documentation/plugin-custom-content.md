## News page

You can edit two fields: 
- The news title is the name of the menu entry
- The content for the page (markdown is supported for formatting)

Deactivate the news: if the title is empty, the menu will be hidden.

## Alert

```markdown
That's how the **alert / warning message** looks like. You can even include _markdown_ and [links](/en/custom-content-news) !
```
