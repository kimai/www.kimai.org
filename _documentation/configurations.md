This is an introduction into the configuration options and files, which are used by Kimai, and an explanation on how to change them. 
 
Specific configuration settings are explained in the respective documentation chapters.

## Configuration files

Configuration of Kimai is done through the files in the `config/` directory, the most important ones are:

- `.env` - your environment and connection settings
- `config/packages/kimai.yaml` - Kimai settings
- `config/packages/fos_user.yaml` - user management
- `config/packages/local.yaml` - **configure your own Kimai settings (does not exist by default)**

There are several other configurations that could potentially be interesting for you in [config/packages/*.yaml]({{ site.kimai_v2_file }}/config/packages/).

{% capture dont_edit_configs %}
Don't edit any of the configuration files (eg. `config/packages/kimai.yaml`) directly, as they will be overwritten during an update.
Adjust settings from any configuration file by adding them in your own configuration in `local.yaml` (see below).
{% endcapture %}
{% assign dont_edit_configs = dont_edit_configs|markdownify %}

{% include alert.html icon="fas fa-exclamation" type="danger" alert=dont_edit_configs %}

### .env

These "environment specific settings" are required so Kimai can boot. They are stored in the `.env` file:
 
- `MAILER_URL` - smtp connection for emails
- `MAILER_FROM` - application specific "from" address for all emails
- `APP_ENV` - environment for the runtime (use `prod` if you are unsure)
- `DATABASE_URL` - database connection for storing all application data
- `APP_SECRET` - secret used to encrypt session cookies (users will be logged out if you change it) 

### local.yaml

The configuration file `config/packages/local.yaml` will NEVER be shipped with Kimai, 
you have to create it before you change settings the first time (eg. `touch config/packages/local.yaml`).
Having your custom settings in `local.yaml` allows you to easily update Kimai. 
This is the same concept which is used for the `.env` file.

An example `config/packages/local.yaml` file might look like this:

```yaml
kimai:
    timesheet:
        rounding:
            default:
                begin: 15
                end: 15

admin_lte:
    options:
        default_avatar: build/apple-touch-icon.png
```

The `local.yaml` file will be imported as last configuration file, so you can overwrite any setting from the `config/packages/` directory.

Whenever the documentation asks you to edit a yaml file from the `config/packages/` directory, it means you should copy 
this specific configuration key to your `local.yaml` in order to overwrite the default configuration.

{% include alert.html icon="fas fa-exclamation" type="warning" alert="Be consistent with the indentation and don't mix spaces and tabs, YAML is very sensitive about that!" %}

### Reload changed configurations

When you change your `local.yaml` configuration file, Kimai will not see this change immediately. 
You have to reload the configurations by rebuilding the cache. 

Read the [cache documentation]({% link _documentation/cache.md %}) for more details.

## System-configuration screen

You can edit most of the configurations from the Kimai UI directly.

This screen is only visible to users with the permission `system_configuration` which is by default given to `ROLE_SUPER_ADMIN`.

Each setting in this screen can also be changed in the config file `config/packages/local.yaml`.

## Data directory

Inside the `data` directory Kimai and plugins will store newly created files.
This location is by default `var/data/`, while files will be managed in sub-directories: eg. `var/data/invoices/` for generated invoices.

The data directory can be changed by adapting the config key `data_dir` in your `local.yaml`:

```yaml
kimai:
    data_dir: "/home/kimai/safe-place/"
```

After changing the data directory, you should move all existing data to the new location and then reload the cache.

## User preferences vs. system settings

A user has several preferences, which change the behaviour how he interacts with Kimai.

Check out the [user preferences documentation]({% link _documentation/user-preferences.md %}) to find out more.

## Adding system configuration

As plugin developer you can add your own sections to the system configuration screen, see [developer documentation]({% link _documentation/developers.md %}).
