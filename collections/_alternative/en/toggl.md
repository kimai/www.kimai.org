## Kimai: #1 Open Source Time Tracking System

### Toggl Track: {make-sure-it’s}-free time tracking

Toggl Track is one of the most well-known names in the time tracking category.
It offers individuals and small teams a user-friendly interface and quick setup. However, its pricing structure can become restrictive as your team grows.

**Pros of Toggl:**

- Simple, minimalist interface
- Cloud-based system — no setup or hosting needed
- Integrations with many project management tools

**Cons of Toggl:**

* The free plan limited to five users (according to Toggle Track's official website as of October 2025)
* Advanced reporting, team management, and billing features require paid plans starting from 9 Euro per user monthly
* No self-hosted option available — data stored on Toggl’s servers

{% alert warning %}
While Toggle OÜ is originally from Estonia, **Toggl Inc. is located in the USA**.  
Due to U.S. regulations such as the CLOUD Act, data hosted with U.S.-based providers may be subject to access requests by U.S. authorities — which can pose privacy concerns for organizations operating under EU data protection standards.  
{% endalert %}

Toggl Track is a solid entry-level tool, but as soon as your team scales, you might hit feature walls or sharp price increases that make open-source alternatives like Kimai more attractive.
