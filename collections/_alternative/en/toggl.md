Speaking in their own words:

> Time tracking software to boost performance and get paid for every billable minute. 
> An intuitive tool that makes time tracking painless for the entire team.

While Toggle is originally from Estonia, **Toggl Inc. is located in the USA**.

Hosting sensitive data with a US company is risky in terms of data privacy, 
as they cannot protect your data against access from US authorities. 

## Moving from toggl to Kimai

Kimai has an CSV importer, that allows to load your toggl data. All you have to do is export the data like this:

{% include docs-image.html src="/images/documentation/toggl-export.webp" title="Exporting timesheet with toggl track" width="800px" %}

Please read the [importer documentation]({% link _documentation/plugin-import.md %}) to find out more.
