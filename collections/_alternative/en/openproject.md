## OpenProject: open source project management 

OpenProject is an open source project management software for optimizing the collaboration of separated teams. 
It takes into account the entire project lifecycle. 
Features include project portfolio management and project and release planning. 
OpenProject offers a free Community Edition as well as an Enterprise Version, between €5.95 and €15.95 per user & month.

**While OpenProject is a software with an extensive project-management feature set, it is not a time-tracking software. 
It can track time, but this is not it's main purpose and many advanced time-tracking features are missing.**
Are you looking for an explicit time-tracker? Then Kimai might be the right choice for you.

Kimai is the best open source time-tracker alternative to OpenProject.
