## Traggo is another open-source time-tracker 

It is a young project, created in Go in 2019 and development seems to have already stalled.
In 2021 there was code activity in 3 days, in 2022 in 4 days and in 2023 in 2 days.

There is no paid support available or any kind of user manual.

It is hard to tell if it will evolve in the future. There seems to be only a tiny amount of maintenance happening.
