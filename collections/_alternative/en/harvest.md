## Why you should choose Kimai over Harvest

Harvest has become one of the most popular time-tracking and invoicing solutions in the market. 
It offers a user-friendly interface and robust features for freelancers and agencies. 
However, its subscription-based pricing model and cloud-only infrastructure can be expensive for growing teams and organizations concerned about data privacy.

Shortly after being purchased by the private equity firm Bending Spoons in 2025, changes were made to the pricing structure, causing many customers to migrate to Kimai — not only because of its stable pricing. 

### Open source alternative with focus on privacy

Kimai stands out as an affordable, open-source alternative that puts control back in your hands. 
Built by developer who value transparency and data privacy, Kimai offers comparable features to Harvest at a fraction of the cost. 
Whether you choose to self-host your instance or use Kimai Cloud with servers located in Germany, you get data protection and GDPR compliance by default.

With Kimai, you're not locked into expensive subscription tiers. You get flexibility, transparency, and the freedom to customize the platform to match your specific workflow needs. 
For organizations that value their data and want to avoid vendor lock-in, Kimai is the perfect choice.

### Cost efficiency at scale

Harvest's subscription model can become expensive as your team grows, with costs multiplying by the number of team members. 
Kimai Cloud offers predictable, per-user pricing starting at just €1/month for some industries, while the self-hosted option requires just the costs of server maintenance. 
For growing teams and organizations, Kimai delivers significant cost savings without compromising on functionality.

## Final thoughts
