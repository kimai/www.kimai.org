## Clockodo: a German time-tracking solution

Clockodo has established itself as a popular time-tracking solution, particularly in German-speaking markets. 
It offers an intuitive interface and solid features for businesses managing their time tracking needs, including flexible absence workflow.

However, as your organization grows, you may be looking for a more flexible, cost-effective alternative that offers greater control over your data. That's where Kimai comes in.

## Time Tracking Requirements on German-Speaking Markets

Companies in Austria, Germany, and other German-speaking regions face specific regulatory requirements when it comes to time tracking.

- **Zeiterfassungspflicht** (Time Recording Obligation) is a fundamental requirement that mandates accurate tracking of working hours. German labor law, for example, requires employers to record the start and end times of daily work periods to ensure compliance with working time regulations and proper wage payment.
- **GDPR Compliance** is non-negotiable for any organization handling employee data in the EU. It sets stringent standards for data collection, storage, and processing. 
- Time tracking systems must ensure that **sensitive employee information is protected** according to these regulations. Kimai is fully compliant with both requirements. 
- Built with **privacy and security** at its core, Kimai ensures that your time tracking data is handled according to the highest European data protection standards. With our German servers, GDPR compliance is built into our platform by design, not added as an afterthought.

## Why Choose Kimai over Clockodo
 
**Open Source and transparent**  

Kimai is the leading open-source time-tracking software, providing complete transparency and flexibility. Unlike proprietary solutions such as Clockodo, Kimai's source code is publicly available, allowing you to verify security measures, understand exactly how your data is processed, and customize the platform to match your specific workflows. This openness builds trust and gives you genuine control over your time tracking system.
 
**Flexible deployment options**

Clockodo operates exclusively in the cloud, which may limit your options if you have specific data residency requirements or want complete control over your infrastructure. Kimai offers you a choice: self-host your instance on your own servers for maximum control, or use Kimai Cloud with secure servers based in Austria and Germany. Whether you need on-premises deployment or cloud hosting, Kimai adapts to your needs rather than forcing you into a single model.

**Made in Austria, hosted in Germany**

Kimai-Cloud is developed in Austria and hosted on German servers. This means your data benefits from some of the world's strictest data protection standards. You can be confident that sensitive business information, including employee time records, remains secure within the EU's regulatory framework—a significant advantage for German-speaking organizations.

**Superior data protection and GDPR compliance**

While Clockodo offers time tracking features, Kimai makes data protection a cornerstone of its design philosophy. With Kimai Cloud, GDPR compliance is guaranteed by default. Your time tracking records are protected under European data protection law, ensuring compliance with Zeiterfassungspflicht requirements while respecting employee privacy rights.

**Scalable cost efficiency** 

Clockodo's pricing can add up quickly as your team expands. Kimai Cloud offers predictable, per-user pricing starting at just €1/month for certain use cases, while self-hosted options require only the cost of server maintenance. For growing teams, nonprofits, and organizations of any size, Kimai delivers significant cost savings without sacrificing functionality or security.

**Comprehensive feature set** 

Kimai provides all the core features you expect from a modern time-tracking system: detailed project and activity tracking, client management, reporting and analytics, REST API for integrations, invoicing capabilities, and flexible data export. Additionally, Kimai's open-source nature means the feature set continuously evolves based on community contributions and user feedback.

## Final thoughts

Clockodo is a capable time-tracking solution, but it comes with trade-offs: cloud-only deployment, limited customization options, and reliance on external infrastructure for data protection. 
For German-speaking organizations that prioritize data sovereignty, GDPR compliance, and regulatory adherence, Kimai offers a compelling alternative.

Kimai combines the reliability and feature-richness you need with the transparency, flexibility, and European data protection standards you deserve. 
Whether you're a growing startup, an established agency, or a medium-sized enterprise, Kimai delivers a modern time-tracking platform built for the European workplace.
