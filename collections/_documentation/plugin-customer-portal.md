## Sharing a customer

The project statistics are only displayed if the customer statistics are active.

You can activate the following options to show further customer details:

- Timesheets
  - Name of the user
  - Rate (hourly rate, total rate)
- Chart options
  - Annual chart (chart with month comparison by selected year)
  - Monthly chart (chart with day comparison by selected month)
- Statistics
  - Budget statistics

## Merging records

Define whether and how to merge records of a day:

- No merging: shows all records as single line
- Merge all records and show the descriptions of all entries
- Merge all records and show the description of the first entry
- Merge all records and show the description of the last entry

## Password protection

You can protect a shared URL by setting a password. 

In that case the user has to enter the password before being able to see the shared data.

## Changing the language

The shared URL contains as first part of the URL the language code, e.g. `/en/auth/customer-portal/0123456789`, which is used to display the content.
You can change the language (here `/en/`) to your required wished language, e.g. `/de/` for German, `/es/` for Spanish, `/fr/` for French and so on ...
