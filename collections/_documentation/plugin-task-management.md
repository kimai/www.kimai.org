## Detail pages

Open tasks will also be shown on Customer/Project/Activity detail pages.

## Dashboard widgets

Two new dashboard widgets belong to the `Task management`.

The amount of rows in the dashboard widgets can be configured in the user-preferences.

### My tasks widget

Displays all tasks which:
- are not "closed"
- are assigned to you

This widget has the following UI elements (if permissions are set for the user):
- a checkbox to close the task (moving to status done will stop all related timesheet entries)
- a title
- a status indicator (colored "red" if the task is `overdue`, otherwise green)
- a "Play" or "Pause" button (pause means that you already recorded times for the task)
- an "Edit" button to change the task fields
- an "Unassign" button (will stop all related timesheet entries and move the task to the "Pending tasks widget")
- a "Delete" button (will remove the task entirely, but keep the related timesheet entries)
- a "Create" button (create a new task for the currently logged-in user)

Visible for all user with `task_start` permission.

### Pending tasks widget

Displays all tasks which:
- have the "pending" status
- are not assigned to a user
- and are either
    - not assigned to a team
    - or are assigned to the users team
    - or the current user owns the `view_all_data` permission (like admins)

This widget has the following UI elements (if permissions are set for the user):
- a title
- a status indicator (colored "red" if the task is `overdue`, otherwise green)
- an "Edit" button
- an "Assign" button (move the task back to the "My tasks widget")
- a "Delete" button (will remove the task entirely, but keep the related timesheet entries)
- a "Create" button (create a new pending task)

Visible for all user with `task_start` and either one of `task_assign` or `task_team_view` permission.

## Permissions

This bundle introduces new permissions, which limit access to certain functions:

A pre-configured permission set for all default user roles is applied by the plugin, please adjust them to your needs.

{% include snippets/store-howto-permissions.md %}

The following restrictions are in place for accessing other user's data:
- can only be seen by users who own the `view_other_timesheet`
- users that own the `task_view` permission but NOT `view_other_timesheet` will only see own/assigned tasks
- the visible data for non-admin users (permission `view_all_data`) is limited by team assignments

A pre-configured permission set for all default user roles is applied by the plugin.
Please adjust them to your needs in "User > Role & permissions" administration.
