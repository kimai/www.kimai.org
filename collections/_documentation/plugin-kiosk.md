## Configuration

You have to **configure the bundle before you can use it** - you reach the configuration via:
- the `Plugin` screen (`Preferences` in action dropdown behind the plugin)
- the Kiosk administration (cogs icon in the upper right)
- the System configuration (`Kiosk & Barcode` section)

The following configurations are available:

| Configuration                                          | Description                                                                  |

## Permissions

This bundle introduces new permissions, which limit access to certain functions:

| Permission Name         | Description                                                                                  |
|-------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `kiosk_admin`           | whether the current user can see the Kiosk administration and assign codes                   |
| `kiosk_own_profile`     | configure codes and user specific kiosk settings (eg. start and end time) for own account    |
| `kiosk_other_profile`   | configure codes and user specific kiosk settings (eg. start and end time) for other accounts |
{: .table }

By default, these are granted to each user with the role `ROLE_SUPER_ADMIN`.
