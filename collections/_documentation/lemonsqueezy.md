description: How to generate invoices for your plugin subscriptions from Lemonsqueezy
---

LemonSqueezy allows customers to generate invoices for orders and subscription payments. 
Customers can generate invoices through the "[My Orders](https://app.lemonsqueezy.com/my-orders)" page in the customer portal, specifically within the billing history section for subscription payments.

To do this, log in to your account at [https://app.lemonsqueezy.com/my-orders](https://app.lemonsqueezy.com/my-orders) using the email associated with the purchase, 
navigate to the relevant order or subscription, and access the invoice from the billing history.

See this [Lemonsqueezy documentation](https://docs.lemonsqueezy.com/help/orders/generate-invoice) for more details.
