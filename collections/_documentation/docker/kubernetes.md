Kubernetes is a container orchestration tool. As such it can use the Kimai docker container in the same manner as shown in the [docker section]({% link _documentation/docker/docker.md %}).

## Helm Chart

There is a prepared Helm chart, provided by a community user, who provides further information and an exemplary set of YAML files defining a complete Kimai setup on Kubernetes.

@robjuz is managing the Kimai helm charts at his GitHub repository:
