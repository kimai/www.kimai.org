title: Roles & Permissions
description: Configure the permission system which is based on user roles 
---

Kimai provides a flexible permission system, which is based on **user roles** and **permissions**, 
which can be turned on and off for these roles. You need the `role_permissions` permission to access the `Roles` screen.

This permission system limits access to the functionality of Kimai.

If you are looking for a way to limit access to timesheets, activities, projects and customers read about [Team permissions]({% link _documentation/teams.md %}).
{% endalert %}

## Roles

Access to functions is handled by the [permission system]({% link _documentation/permissions.md %}), which is configurable through user roles.
There are four pre-defined roles in Kimai, which have a customizable set of ACLs/permissions.

| Role name      | Description                                                                                                                                               |
|----------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| User           | Normal user can track their working times, see basic reports and change their own preferences. Technical name: `ROLE_USER`                                |
| Teamlead       | Manages [teams]({% link _documentation/teams.md %}) with permissions for invoices and access to all **team** timesheets. Technical name: `ROLE_TEAMLEAD`  |
| Administrator  | Can manage all content and timesheet related data, but lack user administration and system privileges. Technical name: `ROLE_ADMIN`                       |
| System-Admin   | Has permissions to manage everything in Kimai, from content to timesheets to users, plugins and system configurations. Technical name: `ROLE_SUPER_ADMIN` |
{: .table }

{% alert danger %}
Every user is automatically member of the ROLE_USER, this behaviour cannot be changed. 

That means, that every role and user owns all permissions from the `ROLE_USER`. 
{% endalert %}

### Creating roles

If the pre-defined roles are not sufficient for your use-case and you need more roles, you can create new ones.

Every user with the permission `role_permissions` can create new user roles. 
There is a button that will open a new modal, to enter a role name. This new role will show up in the table after saving.

{% alert warning %}Allowed character are: `A-Z` and `_`. If you use different character, you might experience strange bugs.{% endalert %}

Custom role names must start with `ROLE_` and need to be written in uppercase letters, so instead of using `Manager` you have to create `ROLE_MANAGER`. 
This is required if you want to test for role permissions programmatically.

## Permissions 

By turning permissions `on` and `off` for specific roles, you widen or limit the access to certain features.
Clicking the `Yes` and `No` labels in the table toggles the selected permission (row title) for the respective role (column title).

If a user has multiple roles, then access is granted as soon as one of these roles own the permission.

**Be aware**
There are other business rules which might limit access to certain functions, so permissions are not the only checks in place.
For example: exported timesheet records cannot be edited, even if a user has the `edit_own_timesheet` or `edit_other_timesheet` permission.
