## Customer

Customers will not be updated, if you import the same file multiple-times, you will end up with several customers with the same name.
You will have to delete the imported customers if you plan to re-import a file.

This will import timesheets and create these elements on the fly:
- missing customer
- missing projects
- missing activities
- missing tags
- missing users

{: .table }

### User handling

If Kimai creates new users on the fly, make sure that you configured the default timezone for new users at [System > Settings]({% link _documentation/configurations.md %}) before the import.
The user timezone is used when importing the timesheets. 
If you import users from different timezones, you need to create the users upfront manually.

### Example

```csv
"Date","From","To","Duration","Rate","User","Email","Customer","Project","Activity","Description","Exported","Tags","Hourly rate","Fixed rate"
"2020-05-04","15:50:00","17:51:00","7260","231.92","John Smith","user@example.com","Customer LLC","My project", "Testing","some work has been done","0","foo,bar","115.00","0"
```

- Date: format `Y-m-d`
- From and To: should be given in 24h format
- Duration: in seconds
- Rate: A floating number of the rate without currency (optional, otherwise Kimai tries to calculate it) e.g. 123.50â‚¬ = "123.50"
- Hourly Rate: A floating number for the hourly rate (optional, otherwise Kimai tries to calculate it)
- Fixed Rate: A floating number for the fixed rate of this record (optional)
- Customer, Project and Activity: will be matched by name
- User: will be matched by username or email
- Exported: can be `0` or `1` (0 = new, 1 = exported)
- Tags: comma separated list of tag names

## Clockify (Timesheet)

Want to switch from Clockify to Kimai? Export the data in Clockify, open it in Excel and export it as CSV file.

The following CSV structure is expected. Import will not work if one of these columns is missing:

| Field name            | Description                                                                                                |

| Duration (decimal)    | The timesheet duration                                                                                     |

```

## Grandtotal (Customer)

There is a [plugin for Mac invoicing software Grandtotal]({% link _store/keleo-grandtotal-plugin-for-kimai.md %}), which adds support for Kimai.

In case your leading system for customers is Grandtotal, you can import customers from a Grandtotal CSV export into Kimai.
Grandtotal calls CSV exports `Numbers` in the export screen.

Attention: Grandtotal exports its data with column names in the UI language (just like Kimai).
Kimai only supports imports for GT exports from the languages english and german, so you might have to change it in `Settings / Languages / User interface`.

## Permissions

| Permission Name | Description                                           |
|-----------------|-------------------------------------------------------|
| importer        | access the administration screen to import CSV files  |
{: .table }

By default, these are assigned to each user with the role `ROLE_SUPER_ADMIN`.
