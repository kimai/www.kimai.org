description: How times, dates and money is rendered in Kimai and exports
---

Kimai uses the time format of the current user locale, which is a configurable [per-user preference]({% link _documentation/user-preferences.md %}).

For example 24 hours are used in Austria and Germany, 12 hours in the USA and Australia and 24 hour for the United Kingdom.


## Translation vs. locale

Kimai uses two main settings for the localization of the UI:

- one setting for the translations (which can also be changed temporarily via the URL)
- one setting for localization of time, date and money values
