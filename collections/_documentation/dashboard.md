The Kimai dashboard displays (so called) `widgets`.
The ones shipped by default can be changed, re-ordered or completely removed.

## User specific widgets

The dashboard can be configured directly by the user via the frontend, every user can have an own set of widgets.

Some widget might require certain permissions to access the data, so different user roles see different widgets.

## Editing the Dashboard 

Upon clicking the {% include demo-action-button.html icon="preferences" title="Preferences" %} button in the top right corner, you can configure the dashboard.

When you delete a widget from the Dashboard, you have to manually click the save button.

If you add a widget to the page it will immediately save this change.

Rearranging widgets is possible, but not all possible combinations will appear as it did in the edit mode.
