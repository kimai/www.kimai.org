    Are you running an agency - whether it's in marketing, PR, design, consulting, HR, or architecture? Then you know how critical time tracking is to your business. Tracking employee hours and client project time is essential for billing accurately, understanding profitability, and managing your growing team.

    But managing time tracking through spreadsheets and disconnected tools can quickly become a mess, especially as your agency scales. That's where a dedicated time tracking solution can be a game-changer.

    Let's explore why successful agencies rely on time tracking software and what essential features to look for. We’ll use Kimai as an example of a user-friendly solution built with agencies in mind.
