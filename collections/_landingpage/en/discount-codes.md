This page explains my discount policy, with which I want to ensure a fair pricing policy for all customers.

**There is generally no discount for plugins in self-hosted installations.**

The only exception to this rule is listed under "Purchasing Power Parity".

### Non Profits

For non-profit organisations that want to use the Kimai Cloud, I offer a [generous discount in the form of an annual plan]({% link _landingpage/en/non-profit.md %}).   

### Cloud

If you choose a paid plan with Kimai-Cloud, you will receive a 20-25% discount if you pay it annually instead of monthly.

### Black friday

I never run seasonal promotions like Black Friday or Christmas deals.
All discount codes found on discount code websites are fake and will not work.

### Purchasing Power Parity

I offer PPP discounts for countries that have a lower GDP than my home country of Austria.
To find out if you are eligible for a discount, go to this [Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_GDP_(nominal)_per_capita), 
and compare your countries GDP per capita (IMF estimate) with the below table. 

| GDP per capita | Discount |
|----------------|----------|
| <  2.000       | 90 %     |
| <  5.000       | 80 %     |
| < 10.000       | 70 %     |
| < 15.000       | 60 %     |
| < 20.000       | 50 %     |
| < 25.000       | 40 %     |
| < 30.000       | 30 %     |
| < 35.000       | 20 %     |
| < 40.000       | 10 %     |
| < 45.000       | 5 %      |

The discount applies permanently to the first order.
If you cancel and want to order again after a break, no new discount will be granted.

When you [contact](mailto:{{ site.support_email }}), don't forget to attach proof (such as the company registration).
The email must also be sent from the company domain. Discounts from Gmail accounts in combination with anonymous
company registrations cannot be accepted.
