This page explains my discount policy, with which I want to ensure a fair pricing policy for all customers.

**There is generally no discount for plugins in self-hosted installations.**

The only exception to this rule is listed under "Purchasing Power Parity".

### Non Profits

For non-profit organisations that want to use the Kimai Cloud, I offer a [generous discount in the form of an annual plan]({% link _landingpage/en/non-profit.md %}).   

### Cloud

If you choose a paid plan with Kimai-Cloud, you will receive a 20-25% discount if you pay it annually instead of monthly.

### Black friday

I never run seasonal promotions like Black Friday or Christmas deals.
All discount codes found on discount code websites are fake and will not work.

### Purchasing Power Parity

I offer PPP discounts for countries that have a lower GDP than my home country of Austria.
To find out if you are eligible for a discount, go to this [Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_GDP_(nominal)_per_capita), 
and compare your countries GDP per capita (IMF estimate) with the below table. 

| GDP per capita | Discount |
|----------------|----------|
| <  2.000       | 90 %     |
| <  5.000       | 80 %     |
| < 10.000       | 70 %     |
| < 15.000       | 60 %     |
| < 20.000       | 50 %     |
| < 25.000       | 40 %     |
| < 30.000       | 30 %     |
| < 35.000       | 20 %     |
| < 40.000       | 10 %     |
| < 45.000       | 5 %      |

The discount applies permanently to the first order.
If you cancel and want to order again after a break, no new discount will be granted.
