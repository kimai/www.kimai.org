As Christmas approaches, many of us look forward to the joy of the season and a well-deserved
break. While Christmas is celebrated in various ways across the globe, we wanted to explore how
European Union members enjoy their public holidays during this festive time in 2024.

ğŸ‡²ğŸ‡¹ Malta and ğŸ‡µğŸ‡¹ Portugal offer just one day off. Meanwhile, several countries celebrate with two days off, 
including ğŸ‡©ğŸ‡ª Germany, ğŸ‡¦ğŸ‡¹ Austria, ğŸ‡®ğŸ‡¹ Italy, ğŸ‡«ğŸ‡· France, ğŸ‡ªğŸ‡¸ Spain, and ğŸ‡¸ğŸ‡ª Sweden. 
Check out our infographic to discover which EU countries offer the longest Christmas breaks!

Looking beyond the EU, we find a country that possibly offers the longest public holidays during the
Christmas season. In some regions of Australia, people can enjoy four days off! Residents of the UK,
Canada, and New Zealand typically enjoy a two-day break, while in the USA, Christmas is marked by
just one public holiday.
