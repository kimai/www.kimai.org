excerpt: "Happy to share that we just hit a major milestone at Kimai: the creation of the 3,000,000th timesheet in the cloud yesterday! ðŸŽ‰"

Over three million timesheets have been logged by our amazing users. 

Of course, this number doesn't include the 700,000 time entries that were deleted due to expired accounts (this one is for you privacy fans).

To all the users of Kimai we'd say: **Thank you for your time!** It goes to:
- Successful and growing teams
- Professional project managers
- Entrepreneurs and business owners
- Time management enthusiasts and all the people who truly understand that time is money

Your trust and commitment to precise time tracking made this milestone possible!
