From today, you can enable two-factor authentication using TOTP (time-based one-time password) tokens.

Two-factor authentication is an extra layer of security for your account, designed to ensure that you're the only person who can access your account.
This feature can be enabled in your [account 2FA settings]({{ site.cloud.url }}/profile/change-2fa) and will be used, the next time you log-in.

If you are unfamiliar with the 2FA process, after using your normal login (via username/password OR via Google/Github) you will be presented with a screen asking you to enter a TOTP code. 
This code is usually generated by an application running on your mobile device, 
There are many free apps available, e.g. Aegis for Android or Google Authenticator for iOS.

To enable 2FA on your account, you will need to scan the QR code with the 2FA app, which will show you a confirmation code.

This feature should be enabled for security reasons by all users, especially those who do not have a working 2FA in place (e.g. via Google-Login).
