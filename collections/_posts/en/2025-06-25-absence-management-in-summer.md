Managing employee absences during the summer months is a real challenge for team leaders and business owners. 
As soon as the weather warms up, vacation requests start to flood in, making it difficult to keep track of who is available and how to maintain business continuity. 
On top of standard leave, summer often brings more untypical break requests during the workday — spontaneous afternoons off, flexible hours, or extended lunch breaks — as employees try to make the most of the season. 
Public holidays only contribute to the complexity of scheduling. 

Without a clear system, summer leave management can quickly lead to scheduling conflicts, decreased productivity, and unnecessary stress for everyone. 
Balancing employee well-being with business needs requires a streamlined, transparent absence approval workflow. 

**Why Summer Absence Management Feels Like Herding Sunburned Cats**

Every summer, managers everywhere face the same existential questions:
- Can the business survive if everyone books the same week off?
- Who will approve the approver’s vacation?
- Why does everyone suddenly remember they have “unspent leave” on the hottest day of the year?
