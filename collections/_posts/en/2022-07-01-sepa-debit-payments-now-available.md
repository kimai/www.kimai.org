Customers located in the EU or with European bank accounts can now pay their cloud bill via SEPA direct debit.

In the revised plan administration area, where your payment types can be managed, it is now also possible to issue a SEPA direct debit mandate.

Due to the various regulations that go along with SEPA direct debits, you will receive an email from our payment provider a few days before the debit.

Please note that in case of failed payments and especially unauthorized chargebacks we will be charged by the banks, we will have to pass these costs on to you.
