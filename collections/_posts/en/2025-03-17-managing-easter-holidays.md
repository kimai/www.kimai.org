Easter is a time of celebration and well-earned rest in many countries. As a business owner, project
manager or team leader, managing this period effectively is crucial to maintaining productivity and
ensuring smooth operations. This article will guide you through the public holidays associated with Easter,
the varying lengths of the celebrations across Europe, and provide tips for navigating the weeks leading
up to Easter and the holiday itself.

### Which Countries Celebrate Easter with Public Holidays?

Easter is one of the most important holidays in many countries, with several observing public holidays
around Good Friday and Easter Monday. Here's a look at some of the countries where these holidays are

### Easter Celebration Duration in European Countries

The length of Easter celebrations varies across Europe, with some countries observing longer periods than others.

Some European nations have extended celebrations. In Germany, for example, Easter can last up to two
weeks in some regions, with schools typically taking a two-week break. In 2025, Easter holidays in
Germany will run from 18 to 21 April, including Easter Sunday and Easter Monday. In Austria, schools will
have an Easter break from 12 to 21 April.

In France, Easter celebrations can also last up to two weeks, with many schools closing for spring break
during this period. In Spain, Holy Week is celebrated for a whole week, starting on Palm Sunday and
ending on Easter Monday.

Some countries have moderate celebrations, for example UK, Italy and Netherlands. In the United
Kingdom Easter celebrations typically last for four days, from Good Friday to Easter Monday.
Sweden, Poland are used to shorter celebrations with Easter Monday as a public holiday.

### Planning for Easter: Tips

Here's how to manage the pre-Easter period and the holidays themselves effectively:

- Communicate Holiday Schedules Early: Inform your team about the official Easter holiday schedule well in advance.
- Set Expectations: Be clear about response times and availability during the holiday period.
- Review Project Timelines: Assess ongoing projects and identify any deadlines that may fall during or immediately after the Easter break.
- Staffing and Coverage: Determine necessary staffing levels for essential tasks during the holidays (Please pay special attention to school children's parents!).
- Utilize Time Tracking Software: Leverage time-tracking software like Kimai to monitor working hours, including holiday time.

When managing international teams across Europe during Easter, consider these varying celebration
lengths, for example plan for potential two-week absences in countries with longer Easter breaks,
like Germany and France.
