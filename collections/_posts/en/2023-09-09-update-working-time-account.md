Today I'm back with the most anticipated and biggest feature update I've ever created for Kimai. 

- Comparison of expected and actual working time
- Yearly working time view
- Monthly approvals with PDF
- Management of public holidays
- Booking of holidays, sickness, time off and other absences
- ... and this is just the beginning, more functions are already being implemented

To find out more, please read the [full documentation]({% link _documentation/contract.md %}).

Please watch the video to learn more:

These new features are available to paying customers (check the pricing table for supported plans).
