Yes! Sad as it is, I’m removing the free plan from the cloud.
It was a tough decision that had to be made after careful thought as it was causing two problems;

- I was my own competitor as almost all features were available for free
- Certain users were in it for the free product

I am slowly getting rid of the clouds that have been up and running for the last 3+ years for free.

I am grateful for the mostly positive feedback and to all my users, most especially the ones that chose to upgrade to the paid plan, Thank you!

**This is the email I sent out to everyone:**

> Hello XYZ,
> 
> Kevin here, from Kimai-Cloud!
> 
> I have some plan and pricing changes to tell you about.
> 
> I've tried a few different models over the last 4 years - always with the goal of helping the most number of people,
> while making sure the business is sustainable (can’t help people if the business cannot survive).
> 
> From the beginning on, there was a free plan. I always had a bad feeling about it, but I kept it going in the hope that it would eventually pay off.
> Which unfortunately never happened.
> 
> **Fast-forward to today, and I do need to make a few changes:**
> 
> 1. As of today, the free plan is no longer available.
> 2. The trial month will be reactivated for your cloud so you can test all the new features you have missed so far. After that month, you'll need to upgrade to continue using Kimai.
> 3. I have introduced [new annual plans](https://www.kimai.cloud/pricing) to make payment and bookkeeping easier. But if you prefer a monthly subscription, I have those as well.
> 
> Features you may have missed include: custom fields, expense tracking, task planning, overtime accounts with holiday/sickness/public holidays, Microsoft or Google login via SAML, audit logs, custom domain and much more.
> 
> Super excited for what is to come! I am heads-down building new API tokens, vacation approval workflow and a working-time management view, while so much more is already on the roadmap.
> 
> Thank you for joining me on this [journey](https://www.kimai.cloud/my-cloud/)!
