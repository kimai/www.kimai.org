excerpt: "Kimai 2.46.0 hardens the Twig export environment to prevent access to sensitive internal data."

## Affected versions

All Kimai versions prior to 2.46.0 are affected by this security issue.

The issue has been fixed in Kimai 2.46.0.

**Kimai Cloud customers were not affected**, as Twig templates cannot be uploaded by users and are only deployed via support after a manual security review.

## Description

Developers with SSH access to the server and permission to upload custom export templates could deploy a malicious Twig export template.
This issue only affected self-hosted installations where untrusted parties had server access and were able to upload export templates.

Such a template could abuse functionality provided by the Twig template engine to access sensitive runtime information, including password hashes and environment variables.

## Resolution

Kimai has introduced additional security restrictions for the Twig environment used during exports and further hardened invoice rendering.

The updated configuration applies a hardened `DefaultPolicy`, which prevents access to sensitive functions, objects, and environment data that are not required for template rendering.

These changes ensure that export & invoice templates are strictly limited to their intended purpose.
