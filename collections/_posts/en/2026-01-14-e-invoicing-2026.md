excerpt: "E-Invoicing (E-Rechnung) is becoming mandatory across the European Union. And 2026 is a turning point, especially for businesses operating in Germany."

An electronic invoice is not a plain PDF sent by email, there is more to it. 
An E-Invoice is a structured, machine-readable invoice that complies with EU standard EN 16931 and can be automatically processed by accounting systems and tax authorities.

In our previous blog post, we explained what E-Invoicing is and why the EU is introducing it.  
Now we’ll answer the most common questions business owners and managers are asking:

- Is E-Invoicing mandatory in 2026?
- Which EU countries have E-Invoicing deadlines?
- What does *E-Rechnung Pflicht* mean for German businesses?
- How can I stay compliant without changing my entire invoicing process?

## E-Invoicing 2026: What Is Changing in the EU?

The main driver behind the new rules is the EU initiative VAT in the Digital Age (ViDA). Its goal is to digitize VAT reporting, reduce tax fraud, and standardize B2B E-Invoicing across all EU member states.

Key points business owners should understand:

- The EU defines technical standards (EN 16931)
- Each country sets national deadlines
- PDF invoices will no longer be sufficient for many B2B transactions
- Structured formats such as XRechnung, ZUGFeRD, UBL/CII, or Peppol BIS will become the norm
- For companies working internationally, early preparation is essential
