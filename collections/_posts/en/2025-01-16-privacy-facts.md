Last week, we hit a significant milestone at Kimai - [our 3 millionth timesheet]({% link _posts/en/2025-01-09-thank-you-3-million.md %})! 

This achievement is even more meaningful because it represents genuine, active usage. We've actually processed more, but we don't count the ones from inactive accounts. 
At Kimai, we believe in quality over quantity, prioritizing honest numbers over inflated statistics.

## Here’s 5 Facts about Kimai's privacy-first approach:

1. 700,000 timesheets were deleted:  We've removed data from inactive accounts, adhering to our principle of data minimization.
2. 17,000 unused clouds were cleared: Abandoned cloud instances have been deleted, ensuring we don't unnecessarily retain or misuse dormant user data.
3. Zero fake numbers: Without external investors pushing for inflated metrics, we stay true to our values and present only genuine growth.
4. Germany-exclusive hosting: All Kimai services are hosted in Germany, providing robust data protection under stringent European laws.
5. GDPR compliance: We've built our platform with privacy at its core, ensuring full compliance with the General Data Protection Regulation.

## Why this matters

In an era where data is often treated as a commodity, Kimai stands firm in its commitment to user privacy and ethical business practices. 
We believe that trust is earned through transparency and respect for our users' information.
Our approach may not yield the flashiest numbers in the short term, but it builds a foundation of trust and genuine value for our users.
