Important update to our support service!

From now on, please send all support inquiries to:
- [support@kimai.cloud](mailto:support@kimai.cloud) – for our cloud customers 
- [support@kimai.org](mailto:support@kimai.org) – for all other clients

We recommend saving the relevant email address to your contact list for quick access - like our customer Mathias Cenas from “Cenas Consulting” who shared:

> Only 1 time I had to submit a support ticket, because we forgot the password!

Centralizing support requests helps us guarantee quick responses and troubleshooting (which, thankfully, isn't needed often). 

For complex questions, we continue to offer screen sharing sessions to help resolve your issues efficiently. 

Please [visit our support page]({% link _pages/support.html %}) if you need an appointment.

And for the technically curious ones: we are using [Zammad - Helpdesk](https://zammad.org/), another successful EU based Open-Source product.
