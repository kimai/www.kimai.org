If you’re a business owner or self-employed professional working in an EU country, it is crucial that you understand e-invoicing and know whether you are compliant. 
Read our guide to find out when you should prepare and how to find the right solution for you.

### The legal backbone: why E-Invoicing is becoming mandatory in the EU

Let's start with the law, because nothing sounds more convincing as an "urgent business priority" than a new directive. 
EU Directive 2014/55/EU requires all companies and public sector organisations in member states to receive and process electronic invoices that comply with the European standard EN 16931. 
This forms the basis of e-invoicing for all business-to-government transactions.

But wait, there's more! The EU’s VAT in the Digital Age (ViDA) initiative is about to raise the stakes. 
Under ViDA, e-invoicing will be mandatory for all cross-border B2B transactions within the EU, and invoices will need to be reported to the relevant tax authority within two working days of issuance. 
This means that paper invoices will soon become the exception rather than the rule, and member states will be able to enforce their own mandatory e-invoicing rules for domestic transactions (without having to ask Brussels for permission).

Businesses will therefore need to create structured, machine-readable e-invoices and report transaction data to tax authorities in near real-time. 
The aim of this shift is to create a standardised, interoperable system for digital invoicing across the EU, reduce administrative burdens and facilitate cross-border trade.

*Short version, if you need it:*

* B2B e-invoicing is rapidly becoming mandatory, with national rollouts accelerating ahead of the EU-wide ViDA deadline
* Your business needs a tool to make structured, machine-readable e-invoices

### What is E-Invoicing, and why does it matter?

E-invoicing is the exchange of invoices in a structured digital format (think XML, not just PDFs) 
that allows for automatic processing by both businesses and tax authorities. 
This ensures faster payments, fewer errors, and most importantly keeps you on the right side of the law.

Why should you care as a business owner?

* Legal requirement: Non-compliance can lead to penalties (and nobody wants a letter from the tax office)
* Efficiency: Say goodbye to manual entry and hello to faster payment cycles
* Cost savings: No more paper, postage, or printer jams
* Compliance: Stay audit-ready

### Who needs to get ready?

If you invoice other businesses (B2B) or public authorities (B2G) in the EU, you’re either already affected or will be soon. 
Even if your country hasn’t pulled the e-invoicing trigger yet, ViDA is coming for everyone, so start preparing now.

E-invoicing rules and timelines differ across the EU. Here’s a quick overview for ten countries (made in October 2025) as examples:

| Country  | E-invoicing Mandate & Timeline                                                                         |

### How to get compliant (and stay sane)

So, you want to avoid fines and keep your accountant happy? Here’s what every savvy business owner should do:

* Research and choose the right e-invoicing solution: Because who doesn’t love spending hours comparing software features and reading user reviews?
* Obtain recipient consent: Yes, you still need to make sure your customers are cool with e-invoices-at least until ViDA makes it universal.
* Test and train your team: Nothing says “smooth transition” like a team that knows what an XML file is (and isn’t afraid to use it).
* Ensure data integrity and security: Cybercrime loves invoices. Make sure your data is stored securely for those inevitable audits.
* Comply with national standards: EN 16931 is the EU baseline, but your country might have its own quirks. Because, of course, they do.
