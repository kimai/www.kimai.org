Can't focus for more than 5 minutes? Welcome to the club! In the 1980s, a university student named
Francesco Cirillo faced the same problem. He was drowning in assignments and couldn't concentrate on
studying. His solution? A kitchen timer and 25-minute work sessions. That simple idea became the
Pomodoro Technique, now used by millions worldwide—from office workers and team managers to
business owners—to beat distractions and get things done.

## From Lost Focus to Laser Precision

It's the end of another day, and you've answered 70 emails, attended 5 meetings, and somehow made

zero progress on what actually matters. Your attention span has probably been chopped into confetti-sized 
pieces by constant interruptions and the myth of multitasking.

Research reveals that it takes 23 minutes to refocus after an interruption. With workers being interrupted
every 11 minutes, we're running on productivity fumes. That's why most of us need the Pomodoro
Technique—a simple method that transforms scattered attention into laser focus.
The Pomodoro Technique was invented in the late 1980s by Francesco Cirillo, a university student
struggling like many others with overwhelming assignments and study schedules. Cirillo couldn't complete
tasks without feeling burned out. His breakthrough solution? A kitchen timer and 25-minute work sessions
followed by 5-minute breaks. It worked so well that millions now use his method.

## How the Pomodoro Technique Works

Here's how to use Pomodoro in your working day:

1. **Pick One Task** Choose one specific task. Not three tasks, not "work on the project." One clear task,
   such as "write report introduction" or "review budget sections 1-3."
2. **Set Timer for 25 Minutes** Work until the timer rings. This is pure focus time. No emails, no Slack, no
   calls. Put your phone on silent. Your attention belongs to this one task.
3. **Take a 5-Minute Break** Step away from your screen. Stretch, grab water, look outside. Don't check
   social media—your brain needs real rest.
4. **Repeat the Cycle** After 4 sessions (about 2 hours), take a longer 15-30 minute break.

## Why People Fail to Use Pomodoro (And How to Succeed)

Let's discuss common issues and difficulties that prevent Pomodoro from improving productivity.

**The Perfectionist Trap:** "I'll start when my schedule clears up." It never will. Start with messy Pomodoros
today rather than perfect ones that never happen.

**The Interruption Excuse:** "But people need me!" Set boundaries. Use a "focus time" signal. Real emergencies are rare.

**Poor Time Estimates:** Most people underestimate task duration. That "quick" proposal isn't one
Pomodoro — it's probably four. If you've previously tracked your time, you can get realistic estimates from
your data to solve this problem.

## Why Pomodoro Works Better with Time Tracking

Working in Pomodoros is great, but without tracking, you're missing the big picture. When you combine
Pomodoro with time tracking tools like Kimai, you gain real insights.
