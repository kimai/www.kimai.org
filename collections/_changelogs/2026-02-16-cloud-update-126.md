title: "Shareable export templates, configure absence calculation, more SAML provider"
date: "2026-02-16 20:00:00 +0200"
---

**Highlights**

- Export templates to be used by regular users (add them to the list in My times / All times) (#5789)
- New configuration: absences/sickness/vacation/public holidays can count toward or reduce the expected working-time
- New API endpoint: check if a date is locked
- Support `Auth0` and `Authentic` as SSO/SAML Provider
- Single user reports: added column summarization per customer
- Added styles and icons for "Working times" with special day events (like absences)

**Improvements**

- Do not show report toolbars in a card, following the general Kimai UI principles
- UI change: removed most toast messages, replacing them by a tiny loading indicator. Toasts were kept for ticktack / restarting of timesheets and error messages.
- Use a new `Strict` SecurityPolicy when rendering the invoice and export PDFs

**Bugfixes**

- The "monthly timesheet PDF" has a closing parenthesis after the personnel number
- Mising "half public holiday and half-day absences" caused to reduce expected working time by only 75%
- Mixing absences with and without duration on one day could mis-calculate working time, depending on creation order
- Wrong dashboard widget labels in German
- API doc (Team ID for new projects)
- Cloud changelog was always shown when editing user-preferences of the currently logged-in user
- Unreadable selected text color in dark mode
