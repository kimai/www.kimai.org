This is an announcement on a planned update during the weekend of 18-20 November.

We have to upgrade parts of our infrastructure and expect several downtimes, each day beginning in the late evening (middle European time CET) and could last for a few hours.

We try to keep the downtimes of your clouds as short as possible.

Thank you for using Kimai!

If you experience any issue, please contact the support at support@kimai.cloud.
