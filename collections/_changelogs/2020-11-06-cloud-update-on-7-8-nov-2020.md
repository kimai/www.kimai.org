title: "Cloud update on 7-8 Nov. 2020"

Over the weekend of 7-8 November 2020, all cloud instances will be updated to the latest Kimai version. The cloud currently runs on Kimai 1.9 and will be upgraded to Kimai 1.11. 

To my great delight, new users are joining every day to use the Kimai cloud. However, this organic growth now requires upgrades to some of the used services.

There will be some some short downtimes during these updates, as some upgrades need to be performed on the cloud servers which are not possible during live operation. These downtimes will happen during the evening hours (Central European Time).

In case of any question or problem, please contact [our support](https://www.kimai.cloud/support-center/request).

## Upcoming changes
