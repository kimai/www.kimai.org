This update took quite a while, because one of the biggest new features "Working-Contract" ever was added ðŸŽ‰

**Working-Contract:** (available for Trial & Premium)
    - Nominal and actual work time comparison
    - Overtime view
    - Monthly approvals with PDF
    - Public holidays management
    - Booking of vacations, sickness, time-off and other absences
    - many more features are planned alreadyâ€¦

**New feature:**

* Added "expected hour" settings for each weekday
* Use "expected hour" instead of "weekend" highlighting
* Added supervisor setting for user (will be used for notifications in the future)
* Collapse "extended settings" on edit screen when clicking anywhere in the title (Expenses & Tasks)
* Invoice: UseÂ {{invoice}}-timesheet.pdfÂ instead ofÂ {{invoice}}.pdfÂ as filename for timesheet exports during invoice creation (avoid automatic renaming from "{{invoice}}.pdf" to "{{invoice}} (1).pdf")

**Improvement:**

* Use to Saturday/Sunday to highlight the weekend (if "expected hours" are not configured)
* Time-tracking: Fix timesheet allows to use deactivated activities
* Importer: Skip certain validations during timesheet import, as they are contra-productive on historical data
* Time-tracking: Deactivate rule to check "maximum duration of entries" by default (caused way too many questions)
* Calendar: Show line breaks (in timesheet description) in calendar popover
* Invoice: Fix invoice due date depends on invoice date
* Fixed weekly-times form does not show global form errors like CSRF token
* Fix invalid user preference (outdated route for homepage) automatically
* Translation updates
* Remove text from tag choice after selection
* Removed "plugin" from permission header (roles screen)
* Removed empty footer on detail pages (Task management)
* Make sure that the account-number has a maximum length of 30 chars (SAML log-ins)
* Allow 64 characters for username (SAML log-ins)
