**Expenses**

- Added system-configuration to disable time field (use 12:00 internally)
- Use "now" as default value for new expenses
- Fixed: "not null" category validator does not highlight correct field

**Working times**

- Send notification email to supervisor for new absences
- Cross-link absence and work-contract page
- Editing absences showed unsupported fields (like "half day" for sickness)

**Improvement**

- Allow to [edit username](https://www.kimai.org/documentation/users.html#username--user-id)
- Redirect to new locale if user edits `own profile`
- Show logged-in user in dropdown, even if it's a `system-account`
- Display and sort by column `system account` in user listing
- Only super-admins can edit their own supervisor
- WCAG: add title/aria-label to many elements
- Sorting user dropdown by `DisplayName`
- Timesheet importer sometimes created project multiple times
- Many translation improvements
