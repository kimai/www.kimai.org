## Changes at a glance 

This update focused on detail improvements and bug fixes and two new features for paying customers: Custom content & Invoice extensions

### Custom content 

This feature is only available for paying customers.

The new menu "Custom content" replaces the recently introduced function "Custom CSS" and extends it with further options. 

- CSS / Stylesheets
- Javascript
- Global alert
- Custom content for news/instructions etc. with markdown support

More documentation is available at [https://www.kimai.org/documentation/plugin-custom-content.html](https://www.kimai.org/documentation/plugin-custom-content.html).

### Invoice extensions 

This feature is only available for paying customers.

- Set a language for formatting money and time values in invoices. The invoice language is then only used for translations. Applies to PDF and HTML templates.
- Automatic generation of another PDF file for involved timesheets. Possibility to configure the export template yourself.

Each of these functions is only active if the corresponding configuration is not empty:
