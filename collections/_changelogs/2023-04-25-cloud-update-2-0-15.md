**New feature:**
- New API `users` parameter to filter timesheets for multiple users
- Allow to call "timesheet restart" with GET to prevent errors

**Improvement:**
- Adjusted error messages for missing invoice sum calculator/renderer/number generator
- Compare tags case insensitive to prevent unique key constraint exception
- Divide by zero for project stats with total duration less than 20 seconds
- ModifiedAt is not set if timesheets are cloned via "create copy"
- Invoice templates: Use `invoice` and `entries` only, remove `model` access, support for new classes `text-begin` and `text-end`
