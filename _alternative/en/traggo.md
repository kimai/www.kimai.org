Traggo is another open-source time-tracker. 

It is a young project, created in Go in 2019 and development seems to have already stalled.
In 2021 there was code activity in 3 days, in 2022 in 4 days and in 2023 in 2 days.

There is no paid support available or any kind of user manual.

It is hard to tell if it will evolve in the future, it seems that the project is not maintained any longer.
