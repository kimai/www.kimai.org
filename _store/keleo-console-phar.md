PHP Command line client for Kimai.

## Features

This command line client should help work Kimai remotely via your favorite shell.

It is based on the PHAR technology, so you need PHP >= 7.3 installed on your machine to use it.

You can find the [full documentation at GitHub]({{ page.github }}).

## Download and install

I cannot help with windows installs, this is only for Linux and Mac:

```bash
curl -LO https://github.com/kevinpapst/kimai2-console/releases/latest/download/kimai.phar
curl -LO https://github.com/kevinpapst/kimai2-console/releases/latest/download/kimai.phar.sha1
sha1sum --check kimai.phar.sha1
rm kimai.phar.sha1
chmod +x kimai.phar
mv kimai.phar /usr/local/bin/kimai
``` 

Before using it the first time, you have to create a configuration file, which holds the connection infos for Kimai. 
By default this config file will be located at `~/.kimai2-console.json`:

```bash
kimai configuration:create
```
Make sure the file is only readable for your own user:

```bash
chmod 600 ~/.kimai2-console.json
```

That's it, you can use Kimai from the command line now, like so:
```bash
$ kimai
$ kimai customer:list
```

By default the configuration file holds credentials for the demo installation ... but now its time to target your own Kimai installation! 
Edit the config file and change the settings: URL, username and API token.

You can find all options in the help:

```
$ kimai
