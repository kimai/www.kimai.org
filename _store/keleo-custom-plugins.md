If you need an extension for Kimai, I am here to develop it for you. 

For example if you want to: 

- connect your token based hardware login system with Kimai 
- send regular reports to your customers
- generate additional statistics for the work of your users and projects

Please contact me via [kevin@kevinpapst.de](mailto:kevin@kevinpapst.de) for any inquiry.

### Pricing
 
Some extensions can be developed on a fixed price basis, if you can provide exact specifications upfront.

If you give your permission to release the extension for the community as part of the Kimai core product, 
we can discuss special pricing.
