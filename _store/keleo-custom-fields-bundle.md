A Kimai plugin, which allows configuring additional fields for timesheets, customers, projects, activities and expenses.

## Features

Configure additional fields for the following entities:
 
- `Timesheets`
- `Customers`
- `Projects`
- `Activities`
- `User`
- `Expenses` - see [Expenses plugin]({% link _store/keleo-expenses-bundle.md %})

The custom fields will be shown on the "create and edit entity" forms and can have the following types:

- `string` (simple text field)
- `integer` (number without decimal point)
- `number` (number with decimal places)
- `duration`
- `money`
- `language` (dropdown of languages, shown in the users language)
- `currency` (dropdown of currencies, shown in the users language)
- `country` (dropdown of countries, shown in the users language)
- `color` (browser specific input element to select a color)
- `date`
- `datetime`
- `email`
- `textarea` (multi-line text field)
- `invoice template` (dropdown)
- `checkbox` (on/off)
- `choice-list` (drop-down)

## Documentation

You can create as many fields as you want for each data type, where each field:

- is either optional or mandatory
- has its own visibility, so the access can be restricted:
    - to certain customer/project/activity combinations (eg. a "location" field will only be shown for customer X and project Y)
    - to users with certain permissions or roles
- can be described with a name and help text
- has a maximum length of 255 character

The custom-field data is then available in:

- Data-tables will display all visible fields
- Exports (HTML and Spreadsheets include all visible fields)
- Timesheet exports (include visible timesheet fields)
- API (collections and entities)
- Invoice templates (custom templates have access to all fields)

You can change the "weight" of custom-fields, so they show up in the order you define. 

Be aware:

- Restricted fields won't be visible on the create forms, as Kimai initially can't know if the rule will apply: in these cases the fields will only be shown in the edit forms
- Sensitive data can be configured as "invisible", so it will not show up in the above mentioned places
- Custom fields for users are not exported via the API (this is a limitation in the core application) 

### Field types

#### Checkbox

Use the value `1` as default value for a pre-checked box or `0` for an unchecked box.

If a checkbox is marked as mandatory, the user has to check it in order to submit the form.

#### Choice-list 

"Choice-list" is a different word for "Select-box" or "Drop-down". 
You have to add the entries as comma separated list into the default-value field.
For example a list consisting of fruits would look like this: `Banana,Apple,Orange,Pineapple,Peach`.

As the first entry is pre-selected, you can add an empty field to the dropdown by starting the list 
with a leading `,` like this: `,Banana,Apple,Orange,Pineapple,Peach`. 
Combined with the mandatory flag, this will force your users to select an entry from the list to be able to submit the form.

#### Invoice template

A select box that is useful if you want to generate automatic invoices via command line / cronjobs.

The Kimai command `bin/console kimai:invoice:create` supports invoice templates via custom-field ([see docs](https://www.kimai.org/documentation/invoices.html#create-invoices-with-cronjobs)).
The option parameter `--template-meta` takes the internal name of the custom field that will identify the invoice template to be used.

## Usage

When logged in as `SUPER_ADMIN`, you should now see the custom-fields administration screen at `/en/expenses/`.

If this was successful, you can now think about giving permissions to other users as well.

### Permissions

This bundle introduces new permissions, which limit access to certain functions:

| Permission Name           | Description |
|---                        |--- |
| `configure_meta_fields`   | allows to administrate the custom field definitions |
{: .table }

By default, these are assigned to each user with the role `ROLE_SUPER_ADMIN`.
