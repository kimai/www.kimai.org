If you need help with the installation of Kimai or want to update Kimai to the latest version, I am available for paid support.
Even though all the necessary steps are documented ([here]({% link _documentation/installation.md %}) and [here]({% link _documentation/updates.md %})), 
they might cause problems for users who are unfamiliar with server systems.

In almost 20 years of work experience I have seen a lot of different server systems and know that its not always easy to integrate new software 
into your existing setup.

If you want to hire me for Kimai installation or updates, please contact me via [info@keleo.de](mailto:info@keleo.de).

### Required information

Depending on the type of setup, I might ask you for different types of credentials and information. These might be:

- SSH connection details and user account
- the database connection and account
- a prepared domain with SSL certificate
- login to your hosters web interface

And if you use a shared hoster and don't know what all that means, don't worry - just drop an [email](mailto:info@keleo.de)

### Pricing

- Updates take roughly 30-60 minutes
- Migration from Kimai v1 takes around 1 to 2 hours (not including the setup)
- Installation takes between 1 to 3 hours (depending on your setup / hoster)
- Costs will be calculated by an hourly price of 100 â‚¬ 
- I offer a recurring update service, so you always have the latest version of Kimai 
- FTP installations are not offered
