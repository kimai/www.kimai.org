A Kimai plugin, which allows you to plan your work and distribute tasks among your users and teams.
It features two new dashboard widgets and a new "Task management" administration view.

## Features

Add "tasks" which are used to start and group timesheet records.

Each task has the following fields:
  - Title
  - End date (optional)
  - User (optional: if left empty, the task can be self-assigned from the "pending tasks" widget)
  - Team (optional: if given, only users from this team see this task and can assign it)
  - Customer (will be copied to the started timesheet)
  - Project (will be copied to the started timesheet)
  - Activity (will be copied to the started timesheet)
  - Description (will be copied to the started timesheet)
  - Tags (will be copied to the started timesheet)
  - Time estimation (optional: if given, a progressbar for duration vs estimation will be shown in the listing page)

Ships a new report, which lists all users with the number of assigned tasks and the progress (via estimation or duration).

This bundle ships two new dashboard widgets (see screenshots).
  - The amount of rows in the dashboard widgets can be configured in the user-preferences
  - With the help of the dashboard widgets every user can manage their work 
   
You can configure the permissions in multiple ways:
  - First version: allows self-management by the user via the dashboard widgets, by assigning to pending tasks
  - Second version: only the "My tasks" widget will be shown, listing page is hidden from "normal users" and teamleads will 
  plan the work schedule (a list of tasks) for the users, who then use the widget to start/pause/stop their assigned tasks. 

A task can reach the "overdue" status, which means:
- the task reached its end date without being finished
- the duration of all logged entries is higher than the estimation of the task  

Task can also be managed via the API. Documentation can be found in the [plugins demo](https://demo-plugins.kimai.org/api/doc) - credentials [here]({% link _pages/demo.md %}). 

## Dashboard widgets

This bundle ships two new dashboard widgets (see screenshots).

### My tasks widget

Displays all tasks which:
  - are not "closed"
  - are assigned to you

This widget has the following UI elements (if permissions are set for the user):
  - a checkbox to close the task (moving to status done will stop all related timesheet entries)
  - a title 
  - a status indicator (colored "red" if the task is `overdue`, otherwise green) 
  - a "Play" or "Pause" button (pause means that you already recorded times for the task) 
  - an "Edit" button to change the task fields
  - an "Unassign" button (will stop all related timesheet entries and move the task to the "Pending tasks widget")
  - a "Delete" button (will remove the task entirely, but keep the related timesheet entries)
  - a "Create" button (create a new task for the currently logged-in user)      

### Pending tasks widget

Displays all tasks which:
  - have the "pending" status
  - are not assigned to a user
  - can be seen by the user (via team assignment or completely unassigned tasks)
 
This widget has the following UI elements (if permissions are set for the user):
  - a title 
  - a status indicator (colored "red" if the task is `overdue`, otherwise green) 
  - an "Edit" button
  - an "Assign" button (move the task back to the "My tasks widget")
  - a "Delete" button (will remove the task entirely, but keep the related timesheet entries)
  - a "Create" button (create a new pending task)   

## Permissions

This bundle introduces new permissions, which limit access to certain functions:

| Permission        | Description |
|---                |--- |
| `task_edit_own`   | Create and edit tasks that are assigned to the currently logged-in user. |
| `task_edit_other` | Allows to edit all tasks that are visible to the user. Create new unassigned tasks, assign team and user. Remove assignment and close tasks which are assigned to another user (stops running records). |
| `task_assign`     | Self-assign a pending task by the currently logged-in user. Required to see the "Pending tasks" widget on the dashboard. |
| `task_start`      | Start a task. Only possible if task is assigned to the current user. Required to see the "My tasks" widget on the dashboard. |
| `task_close`      | Close a task. Possible if task is assigned to the current user or the user owns the `task_edit_other` permission. The task will be removed from the "My tasks" widget after it is reloaded (until then it can be reopened). |
| `task_delete`     | Delete any existing task. |
| `task_view`       | Gives access to the task administration and task reports |
{: .table }

A pre-configured permission set for all default user roles is applied by the plugin, please adjust them to your needs.
 
{% include store-howto-permissions.md %}

The following restrictions are in place for accessing other user's data:
 - can only be seen by users who own the `view_other_timesheet` 
 - users that own the `task_view` permission but NOT `view_other_timesheet` will only see own/assigned tasks
 - the visible data for non-admin users (permission `view_all_data`) is limited by team assignments 

A pre-configured permission set for all default user roles is applied by the plugin. 
Please adjust them to your needs in "User > Role & permissions" administration.
