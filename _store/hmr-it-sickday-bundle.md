## Features

- Track the days of illness of your users
- Upload sick certificate / incapacity certificate as PDF and archive it in Kimai 2
- Automatically adds the times absent to the user's timesheet based on their daily working time

## Requirements

- Kimai v1.13 or higher
- [Custom-fields plugin]({% link _store/keleo-custom-fields-bundle.md %})

## Setup

Create a customer, project and activity for sick days if you haven't already.

Click on `Sick Days` in the menu and select the `Settings` tab.

Here you can select if PDFs are required for creating applications, and the activity for sick days (timesheet entries will be created using this).

If you have the [Custom-fields plugin]({% link _store/keleo-custom-fields-bundle.md %}) installed create a new field for users with `duration` as input field. The time you enter will be inserted into the users timesheet when creating applications.

Using the last input you can limit until when applications can be created. `1` for example, will only let users create applications until today minus 1 week.

## Help
#### Menu

The badge in the menu at the entry "Sick Days" will display the amount of sick days with the "notified" status.

## Permissions

The install-command will create the following permission:
- `sickday_admin`

Users with that permission can create sick days for other users, view the summary screen and change the settings.
