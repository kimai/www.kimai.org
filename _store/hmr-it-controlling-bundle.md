## Features

- See if your users have overtimes or undertimes (since first day in company, per month, per day - all in separate views)
- Check if they violate the German break time law "Arbeitszeitgesetz (ArbZG) § 4 Ruhepausen"
- Users see how much overtimes or undertimes they have + how much they've worked already in the current month and how much they still have to work in the current month
- Filter data per user, time period, and so on
- E-Mail to user to notify him, that he has violated the German break time law via cronjob
- Overview for Administrators to see all calculated times in one view
