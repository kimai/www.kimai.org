If you need help with the installation of Kimai or want to update Kimai to the latest version, I can be hired for paid support.
Even though all the necessary steps are documented ([here]({% link _documentation/installation.md %}) and [here]({% link _documentation/updates.md %})), 
they might cause troubles for users who are unfamiliar with server systems.

From almost 20 years experience with server systems I can say that there is a lot of knowledge required to administrate server 
and software and I'd be happy to support you with the installation and management of Kimai.

If you want to hire me for Kimai installation or updates, please contact me via [info@keleo.de](mailto:info@keleo.de).

### Required information

Depending on the type of setup, I might ask you for different types of credentials and information. These might be:

- an SSH or FTP user account
- the database account
- a prepared domain with SSL certificate
