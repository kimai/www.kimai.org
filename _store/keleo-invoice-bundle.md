You can test the Plugin in the [Plugin demo]({% link _pages/demo.md %}).

## Features 

{% include plugins/invoice.md %}

If you only want to change the locale, you can have a look at the [Fixed invoice data format plugin]({% link _store/keleo-invoice-format-fixation-bundle.md %}).
This plugin here does the same, but offers more features.
