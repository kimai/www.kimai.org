## Local Development and Compilation

TimeKex is a ReactJS Web Application. To run a local development version, you can use NPM to install all dependencies and start or build the app. 

1. Make sure to have [NPM installed](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm)
2. Download/clone this repository to a folder `<folder>`
3. Open the command line, go to that folder (cd `<folder>`)
4. Install packages using `npm install`
5. Start the development server with `npm start`
6. Build the app via `npm run build`

## Deployment

The TimeKex web application is a simple static HTML fileset which can run locally or on any Webserver. When you have build the app, it can simply be started by opening `index.html`.

## Excel Structure Timesheets

![Excel Sheet Structure](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/KatjaGlassConsulting/TimeKex/main/docs/img/layout_excel_sheet.png)

The Excel file is expected in a specific format. When the Excel file should contain a different structure, for example different column names, this can be changed by a source code updated and re-compiling the app. The file `src/features/excelImport/ExcelSchema` is responsible to read in and map the corresponding Excel file to the specific object required for the application. Feel free to update the column names from the Excel file.

The package [read-excel-file](https://gitlab.com/catamphetamine/read-excel-file) is used to read in the Excel file and use the corresponding schema for mapping. Please look into the package details to apply a different schema.

For the Excel file it is very important that the first sheet contains the time data and that the first row starts with the column names. There can be additional sheets and additional columns in the Excel file. The column order is also not relevant. Example file is available under `./exampleFiles`.
