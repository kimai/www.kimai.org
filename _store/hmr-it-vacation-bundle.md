- Full history of every request

## Requires

- [Custom-fields plugin]({% link _store/keleo-custom-fields-bundle.md %}) to save the vacation entitlement per user
- Ability to create and run cronjobs
- Kimai 2, V1.12+

## Documentation
### Setup
Create three custom fields for users using the custom-fields plugin:
- One for the amount of vacation days in the first year in which the users started working (number)
- The other for the amount of vacation days in all other years (number)
- A third one for the daily working time (duration)

If you're logged in as super-admin you will see an item in the menu called "Vacation view". In it there is a settings-tab.
Here you can select the state for public holidays, the activities that will be used as public holidays and vacations.

The last three inputs are dropdowns with all meta-fields. Select the ones you created earlier.

### How to add public holidays automatically

*Important: do the Setup before you run this script! You may want to create a backup before you run this script.*

You may have to adjust your path to composer and you may have to write `php` in front of `bin/console`
Does only work if you use the `git version` of Kimai 2.

Run the following commands:

```bash
cd var/plugins/VacationBundle
bash __create_public_holidays.sh
```

### Roles
The install-command will create two roles:
- `ROLE_VACATION`
- `ROLE_VACATION_ADMIN`

Users with none of the roles won't see the vacation tab in the menu.

If you assign the vacation-role to a user they will see the leave-application tab in the menu.

Super-admins and users with the vacation-admin role have full control over this plugin.

## Updating the plugin

Updating the bundle works the same way as the installation does.

- Delete the directory `var/plugins/VacationBundle/` (to remove deleted files)
- Execute all installation steps again:
    - Copy files
    - Clear cache
    - Update database with `bin/console kimai:bundle:vacation:install`
