    Kimai is a free open source timetracker. It tracks work time and prints out a summary of your activities on demand.
    Yearly, monthly, daily, by customer, by project, by action … <br />
    <br />
    It’s simplicity is its strength. Due to Kimai’s web browser based interface it runs cross-platform.
    Likewise you can install it as a web service or as a single-user program on your local workstation.

    <em>“While there are many programs one can use for time and project tracking, they tend to be overkill for my rather simple needs.
        Kimai came about because I was tired to feed lame boring excel tables …”</em>
</p>
<p>
    Kimai does not have to run to do the recording. You can even quit your browser.
    Your time is still recording until you stop it from any web browser that has access to your installment.
    It is designed to hold lots of users but you can use it for a single user if you need to.
</p>
<p>
    Kimai is localized in more than 15 languages, for example English, German, Dutch, Spanish, French, Italian, Portuguese and many more.
    Feel free to send your self-made language files! Not all localizations are complete – we’re still looking for translators!

    You can also send us your own skin designs (find instructions in the ‘skins’ directory).
    We will also have some skins available in the future.
