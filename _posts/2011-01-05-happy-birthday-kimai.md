Oh what a shame, we all forgot our own birthday... Okay, I have to admit I didn't knew the date - but Torsten told me that Kimai is now 4 years old ;)
and if anyone wants to save the date for next time - its the 15th of December.

I would like to use that date to thank the Kimai community: you are great!
Thanks for all the support, whether its questions, feature requests, bug reports - if you are using by yourself or within your company,
contributing with patches, graphics - now or in the past ...

*Thank you for using and improving Kimai together with us!*

Please let us know how you are using Kimai, how it improves your workflow.
We would like to put up a Testimonial page and you could be part of it. Contact us in [our forum]({{ site.kimai_v1_repo }}/issues).

That would be a great birthday present ;)

And yes, we have a birthday present as well - it'll be uploaded later today and I will let you know in another posting. Stay tuned.
