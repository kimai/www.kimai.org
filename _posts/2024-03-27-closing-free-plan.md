Today I am sharing some news, which are important to me, because making that decision was hard for me.

For a long time I was thinking about removing the free plan from the Cloud, as it was causing two problems:

- I was my own competitor, as almost all core features were available for free 
- Certain users are just searching for free products, they just don't care about the product or mission    

Since a few weeks now, I am slowly expiring old clouds, which were using the cloud for up to 3+ years without paying.

I am super grateful for the mostly positive feedback and the users, that chose to upgrade to a paid plan.

**This is the email I sent out to everyone:**

> Hello XYZ,
> 
> Kevin here, from Kimai-Cloud!
> 
> I have some plan and pricing changes to tell you about.
> 
> I've tried a few different models over the last 4 years - always with the goal of helping the most number of people,
> while making sure the business is sustainable (can’t help people if the business cannot survive).
> 
> From the beginning on, there was a free plan. I always had a bad feeling about it, but I kept it going in the hope that it would eventually pay off.
> Which unfortunately never happened.
> 
> **Fast-forward to today, and I do need to make a few changes:**
> 
> 1. As of today, the free plan is no longer available.
> 2. The trial month will be reactivated for your cloud so you can test all the new features you have missed so far. After that month, you'll need to upgrade to continue using Kimai.
> 3. I have introduced [new annual plans](https://www.kimai.cloud/pricing) to make payment and bookkeeping easier. But if you prefer a monthly subscription, I have those as well.
> 
> Features you may have missed include: custom fields, expense tracking, task planning, overtime accounts with holiday/sickness/public holidays, Microsoft or Google login via SAML, audit logs, custom domain and much more.
> 
> Super excited for what is to come! I am heads-down building new API tokens, vacation approval workflow and a working-time management view, while so much more is already on the roadmap.
> 
> Thank you for joining me on this [journey](https://www.kimai.cloud/my-cloud/)!
