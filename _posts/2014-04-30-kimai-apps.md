Just to let our reader (via RSS feed) know, I created a [page for external applications]({% link _v1/apps.md %}) which make use of our API.

You find that new page at [{% link _v1/apps.md %}]({% link _v1/apps.md %})

These apps could simplify your time-tracking process :)

If you know more apps, let us know in the comments and I will update the page.
