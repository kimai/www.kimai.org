Since Kimai is slowly moving closer to a genuine 1.0.0 release, the need for proper documentation/help to accompany the software is increasing.
We're looking for a new team member, who can make the documentation for Kimai.
Please [contact us]({{ site.kimai_v1_repo }}/issues) if you think you could do this.
Furthermore we're looking for some more official beta-testers.

Before 0.7.0 finally releases some of you may want to have a preview and test its weaknesses.
