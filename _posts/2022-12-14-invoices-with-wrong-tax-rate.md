Dear customers, we have noticed that there was a problem with PDF invoicing for the Cloud. 

Between the end of November and mid-December, invoices from some European customers who are subject to the One-Stop-Shop regulation (i.e. EU invoices without reverse charge) showed a tax rate of 0%, although the correct tax rate was used to calculate the tax amount. 
This visual issue could lead to problems with your bookkeeping. 

Please accept our apologies for the inconvenience and contact us via the support, so I can issue and send you the updated invoice immediately.
