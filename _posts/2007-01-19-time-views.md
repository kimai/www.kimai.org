We are working on some user interface changes.
An important one that deserves to be mentioned is the 'Time View Selector'.
In the current version you can select a day, a month or a year.
This is not as flexible as it ought to be.
In version 1.0 you will be able to define a custom date range.
An example: if a project started in November 2006 and ended in January 2007 you can view this timespace.
Of course there will still be options to quickly select some useful predefined date ranges like last week, a certain month or a certain year.
