Following the longer news about the next major release this news is a quick heads up that the **Beta 2** was just released at GitHub.

You can find the relases [here](https://github.com/kimai/kimai/releases/edit/2.0.0-beta-2).
And if you want to start testing, you can simply switch the version number in the usual upgrade and installation commands to `2.0.0-beta-2`. 

For [Updates]({% link _documentation/updates.md %}) this would be:
```bash
git checkout 2.0.0-beta-2
```

And for [new installations]({% link _documentation/installation.md %}):
```bash
git clone -b 2.0.0-beta-2 --depth 1 https://github.com/kimai/kimai.git
```
