Today a new feature was released for all paying customers: support for own domains.

With the help of this feature you can run your time tracking not only under **your-name.kimai.cloud**, 
but also for example under **time-tracking.example.com**. 

All you need is your own domain and access to the DNS settings of that domain. 
There you have to create a so called CNAME entry, with your cloud domain as destination address. 

In the last step you enter your domain in your profile under **Custom domain**. 
After a few hours you will be informed by email, as soon as your domain incl. valid SSL certificate (which we take care of) is accessible on our servers.
