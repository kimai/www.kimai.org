We are pleased to announce the release of Kimai 0.9.1.

Please look through the beta version announcements to get a list of all changes.
This version brings so many bugfixes and new features that we can't list them all ;D

[Grab a copy]({{ site.download_url }}) of this release and let us know what you think either here or in our [Time-Tracking forum]({{ site.kimai_v1_repo }}/issues).

We hope you enjoy this package!
