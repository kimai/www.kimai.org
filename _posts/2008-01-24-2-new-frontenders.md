We welcome two new developers on the team! Martin 'mort' Klemkow and Enrico Thies join the core team as JavaScript and ExtJS developers.
Some of you may already know mort from the Friendly-Hacks-Section - he is the programmer of the extension "Simplestats"
(which is great and was going to be part of the next version anyhow).

We're looking forward to your ideas and improvements!
