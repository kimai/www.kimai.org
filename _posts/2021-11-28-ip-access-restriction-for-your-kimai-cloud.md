Today a new feature has been enabled for all paying customers: IP based access restriction.

With the help of this function you can restrict the accessibility of your time tracking for up to 5 different IPv4 addresses. 
As soon as an IP has been stored, only access from there is allowed. 
Access from all other addresses is answered with an error page.

To activate the function, enter your IP address(es) in your profile under [Access restriction to IP address]({{ site.cloud.url }}/my/ip-restriction/) (link only works when you are logged-in).
