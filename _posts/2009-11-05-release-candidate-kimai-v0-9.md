We are pleased to announce a release candidate for the next Kimai version.

Just a quick note for all out there that a release candidate for Kimai v0.9 is available.

Big thanks fly out to Severin, our new team member.
He contributed a big amount of his free time, added great code, new features and improvements.

If you want to help us and test the software, you can find it at the [Kimai Sourceforge Page](https://sourceforge.net/projects/kimai/) or
[download it directly](http://sourceforge.net/projects/kimai/files/kimai_0.9.0.1074.zip/download).

Feedback about this version can be posted in the [Beta test forum]({{ site.kimai_v1_repo }}/issues).
