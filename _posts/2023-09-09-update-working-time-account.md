Today I'm back with the most anticipated and biggest feature update I've ever created for Kimai. 

- Comparison of expected and actual working time
- Yearly working time view
- Monthly approvals with PDF
- Management of public holidays
- Booking of holidays, sickness, time off and other absences
- ... and this is just the beginning, more functions are already being implemented

These new features are available to all customers on the **Premium** and **Pro** plan.
