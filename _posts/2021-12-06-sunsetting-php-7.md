Okay everyone, this is reminder that you need to monitor the [PHP lifetime support](https://www.php.net/supported-versions.php) on a regular basis.

![Edit](/images/news/sunset-php-7.png "Supported PHP versions in December 2021")

As you can see from that screen the Support for PHP 7.3 is entirely out of life.
The latest version from PHP 7 which is still supported is 7.4 - and that one only for security updates.

So it is finally time to move on and into the future of PHP. **The next release 1.17 will be the last one that will support PHP 7.x.**
All major libraries that Kimai depends on already support PHP 8 and some of them already require it for updates.

So Kimai will be PHP 8 only soon. Please prepare your servers and upgrade your PHP as soon as possible!
