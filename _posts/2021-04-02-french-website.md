A quickie news for all the french speaking users out there:

> The Kimai website is now translated to french and available at: [https://www.kimai.org/fr/](https://www.kimai.org/fr/)

There is a language switcher in the upper right corner of the websites desktop version and links in the dropdown menu of the mobile version.

This translation was provided by @RaphaelLaurent who worked on it together with me.
After almost 4 months (with long breaks in between) we reached the goal and now it's much simpler to translate the website.

Several parts of the website had to be changed internally, to allow simpler translation to more languages.   
This is ready now and the logically question is: **who wants to contribute the next translation?**
