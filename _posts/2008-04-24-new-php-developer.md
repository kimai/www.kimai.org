Only four days after Tom's exit we are very happy to announce that Oleg Britvin joints as new PHP Core-Developer.
We now dare to forecast that version 0.8 of Kimai will probably be released in August.
The genuine 1.0 release is focused for Kimai's second birthday December this year.

Please, we're still looking for translators!
