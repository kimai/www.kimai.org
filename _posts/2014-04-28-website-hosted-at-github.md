Hi folks, its been a long time since my last posting.
Today I wanted to let you know, that we are still alive and work on Kimai is slowely progressing.

We (Severin and I) do know that you are waiting for a release, but we have very limited resources to work on Kimai and
could need some helping hands. To achieve a more community driven approach, I migrated the documentation and even this website to GitHub.

Check out the repositories:

- [https://github.com/kimai/documentation](https://github.com/kimai/documentation)
- [https://github.com/kimai/kimai.github.io](https://github.com/kimai/kimai.github.io)

For the techies: the website is now hosted using GitHub pages with a custom Jekyll theme. Super fun!
If you didn't use it yet, you should give it a try.

If you are interested in helping us with [the documentation](http://www.kimai.org/documentation/developer/documentation.html),
the new one is based on GitBook and [hosted here](http://www.kimai.org/documentation/).
You can simply fork [the repository](https://github.com/kimai/documentation) and send us pull requests. We will publish them to the gh-pages branch after merging.

For all of you waiting for the next release: we are working on it! If you could offer your help in testing, that would be great.
If you could offer your help in fixing [open issues]({{ site.kimai_v1_repo }}/issues) that would be even better :)
