For paying corporate customers, there is now a new way for employees to log in to the cloud.

All Google Workspace customers with a paid Kimai plan can now create a SAML app and link it to their Kimai Cloud.

With this SSO (Single Sign-On) solution, security is further enhanced as accounts are managed centrally and the use of 2FA (two-factor) authentication via Google is possible.
Existing user accounts are automatically merged if the unique user ID matches in both systems.

You can also decide whether to leave login via username/password in your cloud open or disable it completely.

More information on how to set this up can be found [in the documentation]({% link _documentation/cloud/cloud-saml.md %}).
