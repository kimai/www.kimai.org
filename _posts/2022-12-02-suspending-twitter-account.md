This short post is to inform them that the Kimai Cloud Twitter account will be discontinued immediately and deleted within the next week.

This decision is mainly based on the fact that there is already one Twitter account for the open-source version of Kimai.
This account will be utilized for all communication in the future. 

Give us a follow at Twitter and please use the support section for any questions.
