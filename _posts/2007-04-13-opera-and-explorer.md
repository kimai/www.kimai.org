Kimai's upcoming beta will now work perfectly with Opera.
Its CSS and Javascript behavior are almost the same as in Firefox.
Internet Explorer seems to be a bit of a problem though.
Explorer handles the DOM in a different way than other browsers.
Due to that it may take a bit of work here.
If somebody has experiences regarding the HTTP-Request behavior of jQuery under Internet Explorer, I welcome any hints ;)

So, Kimai 0.7.0 will fully support Opera (tested on 9.20).
Internet Explorer (up from version 7) might then be supported in the following beta version.
