    community: |
        There is a great and large community around Kimai and it is impossible to list them all. Below is a short list of past developers. The marketplace lists plugins and their developers, which gives you a good idea of the developers who support the project with their knowledge.

        Many other people contribute their free time by providing feedback, test reports and constructive questions. Their names can be found regularly in the GitHub issue tracker and discussion forum. My biggest thanks go to all of them ❤️
    current: |
        Kimai is a time tracking app with a long history. The first version was released back in 2006. Why do I mention that? Because I have seen so many services come and go since then - believe me when I say: I'm sticking around. I didn't make a living from Kimai for many years, it was the fun that kept me motivated to improve Kimai. I believe that fun is one of the main reasons for Kimai's success.

        I build Kimai for one purpose: to track your working hours. Kimai supports an unlimited number of users and timesheet entries, so you can manage all your teams/departments in one easy to use installation. Kimai is web based, so all you need is a PHP enabled web server. It's built with a responsive design, so you can even track times on your mobile device when you're on the go. Kimai is translated into multiple languages and missing translations can be easily added using the open translation standard Xliff.

        Oh, and did I mention that you can create invoices from your timesheets in your browser? Kimai can be easily extended in many ways. It's built on the most popular and modern frameworks and has an active community that produces a lot of plugins that extend the core functionality of Kimai.

        I could write so much more about the features and benefits that Kimai can bring to you - whether you are a freelancer, a small organisation or a company with hundreds of employees - but I think giving you the opportunity to try it directly is even better than a thousand words from me.
    past: |
        Kimai has a long history and was way ahead of its time when Torsten Höltge and his team started developing it in 2006. It had a responsive design (thanks to a lot of Javascript magic) before the word had even been officially invented.

        He was about to shut it down for personal reasons when Kevin stepped in as maintainer in 2009. With the help of other open source volunteers, he kept it alive and growing for several years.

        In the meantime, the PHP community had made great strides forward, and Kimai felt left behind due to its technical history - built around a lot of individual PHP scripts, all of which had to be publicly available. It also had some major drawbacks, such as limited extensibility and a problematic database design. After many years of development, the codebase had become difficult to maintain and the logic was scattered across scripts, classes and the frontend layer.

        Therefore, the idea of rewriting Kimai with modern frameworks had been around for a long time, also driven by community requests, but there hadn't been time to push these ideas forward. At the end of 2017, Symfony 4.0 was released together with a nice frontend stack. That's when I took the opportunity to start developing the next evolutionary step: the Kimai (v2) was born.

        The original Kimai was first released in 2006 and has been used by many people around the world. I am proud of this and of the great community. Now, after 5 years, most people have migrated to the new Kimai version and the number of users is growing every day. That's why I would like to thank everyone who has contributed to Kimai.
