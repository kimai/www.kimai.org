    purchase_details:
        - title: How is the plugin licensed?
          content: 'All paid plugins are annual subscriptions. Read more about the exact <a href="/en/terms-plugins.html">license details here</a>.'
        - title: Where can I buy this plugin?
          content: 'You can buy the plugin via the Marketplace **LemonSqueezy** and pay with Credit Card or PayPal for immediate access. You can also <a href="mailto:support@kimai.org">get in touch</a> and pay with wire transfer or SEPA, but you will have to wait a few days before getting access to the plugin.'
        - title: Where can I get support for this plugin?
          content: 'Basic support is included and I am happy to help occasionally with simple issues. Larger support-questions, bug-reports and feature-requests will be answered in this <a href="https://github.com/kimai/Paid-plugins" target="_blank">Github repository</a>. Customers who bought a plugin **including** support can write to <a href="mailto:support@kimai.org">support@kimai.org</a>.'
        - title: What happens if I cancel the subscription?
          content: "If you purchase a plugin subscription, you’ll receive all updates, bugfixes, and support for one year. After the subscription ends, your plugin will continue to work without any restrictions – you can keep using the last version you downloaded. This model is known as a **perpetual fallback license**. However, access to future updates, new features, and compatibility fixes require an active subscription."
        - title: Do you offer refunds?
          content: "Since Kimai plugins are downloadable products, I am unable to offer refunds. Once you download the source code, it’s yours to keep, and I can’t retrieve it. The same applies for subscriptions that were not canceled in time."
