    purchase_details:
        - title: How is the plugin licensed?
          content: 'All paid plugins are annual subscriptions. Read more about the exact <a href="/en/terms-plugins.html">license details here</a>.'
        - title: Where can I buy this plugin?
          content: 'You can buy the plugin via the Marketplace **LemonSqueezy** and pay with Credit Card or PayPal for immediate access. You can also <a href="mailto:support@kimai.org">get in touch</a> and pay with wire transfer or SEPA, but you will have to wait a few days before getting access to the plugin.'
        - title: Where can I get support for this plugin?
          content: 'Basic support is included and I am happy to help occasionally with simple issues. Larger support-questions, bug-reports and feature-requests will be answered in this <a href="https://github.com/kimai/Paid-plugins" target="_blank">Github repository</a>. Customers who bought a plugin **including** support can write to <a href="mailto:support@kimai.org">support@kimai.org</a>.'
        - title: What happens if I cancel the subscription?
          content: "If you purchase a plugin subscription, you’ll receive all updates, bugfixes, and support for one year. After the subscription ends, your plugin will continue to work without any restrictions – you can keep using the last version you downloaded. This model is known as a **perpetual fallback license**. However, access to future updates, new features, and compatibility fixes require an active subscription."
        - title: Do you offer refunds?
          content: "No, refunds are not available. Kimai plugins are delivered as digital downloads and cannot be returned once the source code has been accessed. Additionally, payment providers charge non-refundable transaction fees, even if a refund were issued. For these reasons, all sales are final. The same applies for subscriptions that were not canceled in time. Please try the demo versions or contact us before purchase if you’re unsure whether a plugin fits your needs."
