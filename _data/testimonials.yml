        Kimai is my most beloved business tool!

        My real world problem would be automating this sequence I do: prepare a "time only" "invoice" pdf in kimai and send it zapier, create an e-invoice in "Fatture in Cloud" with the timesheet attached (can't use kimai, e-invoice mandatory).'

    text: "When I started to identify a time reporting software for our medium size enterprise (~30 people distributed all over United States and Canada) in the software service industry for onsite and remote services, I had several programs in my mind. In my specification I had the following things to be covered\n- Customer related time reporting\n- Project related time reporting\n- Time approval\n- Various hierarchies in user and access levels\n- Open data interface for potential interfaces to other software packages (such as various payroll software packages for Canada and US, ERP for invoicing) \n- Time budget for hourly packages\n- Time reporting to customers with time budget\n- The data is mine and I always want to have access to it\n- I would like to create plugins if I need to add features that do not yet exist\n\nI continued my search but always came back to Kevin Papst’s time reporting software Kimai. So I installed it on a shared host. I continued to set up a few users and imported a few customers, projects and finally understood how activities are to be set up (global and local). This is a feature that surprised me even more. Well implemented! I finally rolled it out to a small group and then the entire team. The time reporting is now fully implemented within 2 months from first idea to fully operational. \n\nThen the demands grow with the possibilities: I purchased a few plugins and these were installed as simple as the main software. Then, when I had even more requests that I didn’t find an answer by plugins, I reached out to the developer Kevin asking for help with changing a report and he simply answered to consider this for the entire software, not just a module for me. It may be within some of the next releases.\n\nIn summary, <mark>Kimai is a flexible time reporting package with active code, modern, responsive and fast user interface and a fast responding support</mark>.\n\nThanks, Kevin, for this nice software package!"

        Wir setzen KIMAI seit vielen Jahren ein, früher selbst-gehosted bei einem Internet-Provider, seit einiger Zeit in der Cloud. Das Daten-Modell passt hervorragend zu unserem Geschäftsfeld, in dem wir bestimmte Projekte nach Aufwand berechnen, andere zum Festpreis (budgetiert). Beide Abrechnungsmodelle werden von KIMAI unterstützt. Bei budgetierten Projekten behalten wir die Übersicht über den jeweiligen Verbrauch an Zeit und Kosten in Relation zum Budget (Burndown). Bei Projekten nach Aufwand exportieren wir monatlich oder quartalsweise alle abrechenbaren Zeiten mit den hinterlegten Stundensätzen als Grundlage für die Rechnungen, die wir mit einer anderen Faktura-/Buchhaltungs-Software erstellen.

        Neben dem aus meiner Sicht sehr praxisgerechten Daten-Modell und der logischen Struktur ist die Cloud-Lösung auch optisch und von der Handhabung her sehr gut gelungen, modern und intuitiv bedienbar. Ich finde alles dort, wo ich es erwarte. Zahlreiche kleine Features, etwa das Ausblenden von Spalten oder die Filter-Möglichkeiten, erleichtern die Arbeit. Zudem ist erheblich viel konfigurierbar, so dass ich nicht gezwungen werde, meine Prozesse an KIMAI anzupassen, sondern ich kann KIMA an meine Bedürfnisse anpassen.

        Der Support reagiert sehr schnell. Zudem konnte ich schon mehrere Vorschläge einbringen, die tatsächlich zeitnah eingeflossen sind. In dieser Umsetzungsstärke habe ich es bisher bei keinem anderen Anbieter von Cloud-Lösungen erlebt.

        Aus Überzeugung und unentgeltlich habe ich es befreundeten Geschäftspartnern aus ganz anderen Branchen gezeigt, empfohlen und sie bei der Einrichtung unterstützt.

        Aus meiner Sicht eine absolute Empfehlung, sehr professionell und gut durchdacht. Man merkt der Software die Reife und dem Hersteller die Erfahrung in diesem Gebiet an.

Easy to setup and use right away, with many options for adapting it to specific needs and processes. One tip for first-users: Projects have to be set up in Administration in order to be able to start time tracking - so far that's the only thing that got me searching.

        Kimai hat mich wirklich überzeugt. Ich habe lange nach der für uns richtigen Lösung gesucht. Die Vorgaben war eine preisgünstige Lösung für viele Mitarbeiter bei der ich nicht für eine Teilzeitkraft eine 30 EUR / Monat Lizenz kaufen muss.
        Dabei hat Kimai (läuft bei uns am Server) aber alle (und mehr) Funktionen die wir benötigen. Vor allem Start / Stop über Browser und App, Zuordnung Projekte uvm. sind optimale Funktionen.
        Es ist die Zeiterfassung die ich Agentur-Freunden empfehlen würde.

            However, Kimai (which runs on our server) has all (and more) of the functions we need. Above all, start/stop via browser and app, assignment of projects and much more are optimal functions.

Instead of using expensive service providers, we were able to use Kimai, the Kiosk plugin and the plugin for working hours to create our own low-cost version, which now works reliably.
            Many thanks to Kevin, the creative mind in the background, who always provides the right solutions. We are completely satisfied with Kimai.

        Kimai has been a fantastic discovery. I reviewed several other time trackers, and frankly, none of them compared. Kimai just felt better right away. It’s easy to set up and use, with a clean design and just the right balance between features and simplicity, and the self-hosting option is a huge plus.

        Highly recommended and big thumbs up from me!

            We recently made the switch from Toggl to a self-hosted Kimai. As a TYPO3 agency, open source, data sovereignty, and full control over the software were essential to us. We wanted to decide ourselves when to enable specific features and have the freedom to implement our own customizations. The migration of data from Toggl to Kimai was smooth, and our team quickly adapted to the interface, which resembles Toggl but offers more advanced options—especially for reporting and analytics.

        As a freelancer, time keeping is really important. Kimai makes it a breeze doing so.
        Thanks to the API I can automatically start and stop timings when arriving/leaving my customers' premises.
        And best of all, it's from Europe! :-)
        Thanks for making such a nice software !

        An dieser Stelle mal am Rande ein Dankeschön für Kimai.
        Anfragen die man hat, werden wirklich zeitnah, freundlich und kompetent beantwortet.
        Für uns als kleinem Anbieter von sozialen Dienstleistungen ist es toll, daß wir ein so professionelles Programm als Basisversion gratis benutzen können. Selbst wenn kostenpflichtige Module dazukommen sollten, ist es ein gutes Gefühl, daß das Geld in eine engagierte, kleine Softwareschmiede fließt.
        👍🏼👍🏼👍🏼
        ❤️

            At this point, I would like to say a big thank you to Kimai.
            Any queries you may have are answered promptly, politely and competently.
            For us as a small provider of social services, it's great that we can use such a professional programme as a basic version free of charge. Even if paid modules are added, it's a good feeling to know that the money is going to a dedicated, small software company.
            👍🏼👍🏼👍🏼
            ❤️

            Kimai has been with my company since the very beginning. As a service provider, it is important for us and our customers that we can bill for projects down to the minute. Our customers appreciate the clear overview of the work performed (duration, activity, etc.). We appreciate no Excel, everything in one place, faster and easier support, open source, and many other features.
