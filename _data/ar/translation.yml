This is because Composer needs to run on the command line.\n\nThis doesn’t necessarily mean you need a VPS. Some shared hosts give you SSH access, through which you should be able to install Composer and Kimai just fine.\n\nFull installation instructions can be found in our %documentation%.\n"
        intro: The recommended way to install Kimai is to use `git` and `composer` directly on the target system.
