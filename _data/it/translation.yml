        alert-vps: |
            At this stage, it’s not possible to install Kimai by downloading a ZIP file and uploading the files to your web server. This is because Composer needs to run on the command line.

            This doesn’t necessarily mean you need a VPS. Some shared hosts give you SSH access, through which you should be able to install Composer and Kimai just fine.

            Full installation instructions can be found in our %documentation%.
