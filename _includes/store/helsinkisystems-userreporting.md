## Description

A detailed user reporting bundle. It generates a more detailed report about what projects, activities and customers take up how many time and what budget.

## Installation

This plugin does not need a database table, so there is no installation of the plugin necessary.
However, it comes with an automated email reportingfunctionality at the end of the month. To enable this, you have to run the following command:
```
php bin/console kimai:bundle:userreporting:monthlyreminder
```
{% include composer-update-warning.html %}
