If you want to change the look and feel of Kimai, you can use this bundle to add your own CSS rules.

Examples styles can be found in the documentation.

**Alternative**

If you want to add custom Javascript (or add a custom page with markdown content or show a site wide message), 
please have a look at this item instead: {% include link-translated-shop.html item="custom-content-bundle" %}

### Storage

This bundle stores the custom CSS rules in the file `var/data/custom-css-bundle.css`.
Make sure it's writable by your webserver and included in your backups.
