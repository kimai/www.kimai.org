## Description

BudgetWatcher plugin for Kimai is a plugin that allows you to keep track of your projects' budgets. It sends notifications to a user group when a certain amount of the project budget is used up. Both the user group and the budget amounts at which you want to be notified are fully customizable. You can set default amounts that apply to all projects, or individual amounts for individual projects. You can also set as many amounts as you want.
For example, you can set the default amounts to 50%, 75%, and 95%, and for another project to 80% and 95%. Whenever the budget is exhausted up to this percentage, the specified user group receives an email that this amount of the budget has been used up, and you can adjust the budget accordingly if necessary.
