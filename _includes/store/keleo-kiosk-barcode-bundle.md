A Kimai plugin, which allows using barcodes for `punch-in` and `punch-out` time tracking with Kimai.
You can use it with a barcode scanner, with a web-camera, with a RFID reader or an NFC reader.    

It also supports a "freestyle" mode, which allows to enter any free configurable code (up to 120 characters), 
so you can also use other devices for starting/stopping:
- an electronic USB number-pad
- an RFID scanner that acts as keyboard 
- an Android device with [Web NFC support](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/NDEFReader) (only Chrome browser)

This bundle is the solution for you, if you want to use Kimai in a kiosk mode, where users register their
attendance time through punch-in (coming) and punch-out (leaving) mode.

It could be as simple as:
- Hand out NFC or RFID tokens to your employees 
- Mount a tablet to the wall in your entrance room
- Let your users check-in & check-out when entering the building by scanning their tokens

You can test it in the ["Plugins" demo](https://www.kimai.org/demo/).

### Hardware

**Self-built setups**

This is NOT a hardware recommendation, but more an idea for possible use-cases.

I tried the linked products and even though all scanner are rather cheap, they work without problems.

- [Raspberry PI](https://amzn.to/2Ye8LeK) setup with [touch screen](https://amzn.to/321jg6k) (eg. for wall mount)
- [RFID scanner](https://amzn.to/3aM5yby) by Neuftech (desktop version)
- [RFID scanner](https://amzn.to/3hfwDpK) by KKMoon (desktop version)
- [Barcode scanner](https://amzn.to/3g6HzEU) which can also scan codes from mobile phones (desktop version)
- [Barcode scanner](https://amzn.to/2Q9KWAy) classic hand-held version

Above are affiliate links for Amazon (Germany) where I bought them myself. 

**Meeting-Room Tablet with NFC**

This proposal contains a tablet which can be wall- and VESA mounted, has WLAN and only needs a tiny AC adapter. The NFC reader is on the front, so users can easily scan their tokens.

You need a Kiosk application, which makes sure that users always see the login screen:

- Kiosk application: [Android Kiosk](https://www.android-kiosk.com/)

And you need a bunch of NFC tokens:
