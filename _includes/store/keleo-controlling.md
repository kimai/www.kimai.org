## Features

**Certain features are not yet here, but already planned (see Roadmap below). Your feedback will be incorporated.**

- It enhances the [Working times]({% link _documentation/contract.md %}) view with 
  - Manual bookings (adjust the time account with plus or minus hours)
  - Overview of the entire year with results per day, the ability to close a month, download result PDF and more
  - See if a user has overtimes or minus hours (since first day in company, per year/month/day)
  - Monthly approvals (per user) with PDF handouts that contain the working-hour details for the entire month
  - See if your users have missing days (no times entered on days where they had to work)
- It adds the [Absence]({% link _documentation/absence.md %}) view, which allows to
  - Create holidays (half-days possible)
  - Take time-off (if account has overtime)
  - Create sickness days
  - Create other absences (e.g. unpaid leave)
  - Automatically adds the times absent to the user's timesheet based on their daily working time
  - Export absences per user to Excel
- And it adds the new [Public holiday]({% link _documentation/public-holiday.md %}) management view
  - Allows to create different groups (e.g. for different countries or states) and add public holidays to each of them 
  - Import and manual creation of public (local) holidays
  - Public holidays will automatically be added to the user's timesheet (a user can only be in one public-holiday group)
  - Public holidays can be imported automatically (if your country is supported - most are, some holidays might be missing).
- Per user contract settings
  - Expected working hours per day of the week: Monday/Tuesday/Wednesday/Thursday/Friday/Saturday/Sunday
  - Vacation entitlement per user for the calendar year
  - The "starting day" limits the working hours calculation from that date until "now"

## Ideas 

The next list is a collection of feature wishes from users, which might or might not be added. 
If you need one of these features, do not rely on them being added, but contact me upfront to discuss your needs.
If the above list is empty or I decide to add a feature, it will be moved to the "Planned features" section.
