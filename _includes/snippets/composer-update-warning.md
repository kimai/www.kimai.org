{% note "UPDATE WARNING" %}
As this plugin uses composer to install further dependencies, your next update will not work as usual.
Please read this <a href="{% link _documentation/updates.md %}#changed-files">troubleshooting guide</a> how to handle the situation.
After reverting all local changes and updating Kimai, you have to reinstall the composer package.
